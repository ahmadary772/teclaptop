    nameForTOC: Asrock B450M Pro4
    specifications:
      - specification: "**ASRock brand; AMD B450 chipset; AM4 socket; Micro ATX form
          factor; 64 GB DDR4 memory; 2400 MHz memory speed**"
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          The company's premium line of motherboards is called Asrock Taichi,
          while its entry-level line is called **Asrock Pro4. Based on the
          B450** chipset introduced with the second generation of AMD Ryzen
          processors, the **Asrock B450M Pro4** is the best Micro ATX
          motherboard for the Ryzen 5 3600X. With Ryzen processors, this chipset
          is both forward and backward compatible. The Micro-ATX form-factor,
          which is smaller than the common ATX form-factor and has more case
          compatibility, is what the **Asrock B450M Pro4** has. With a black and
          grey colour scheme, the motherboard's design is remarkably similar to
          that of the Asrock B450 Pro4, which has an ATX form factor. This
          motherboard appears to be rather inexpensive because it lacks an I/O
          cover and has a small chipset heat sink.


          The conventional 24-pin ATX connector is located at the motherboard's right edge, while the 8-pin connector is close to the VRM heat sink. It has four DIMM slots and is compatible with AMD's Ryzen 5 3600X processor, allowing for a maximum memory capacity of **128 GB when utilising 32 GB DDR4** DIMM sticks. If you're lucky, you might be able to push the motherboard's maximum DDR4 RAM speed of 3200 MHz a little bit higher.The main distinction between this motherboard and the B450 Pro4 motherboard is that the former has six PCI-E slots, while the latter has only three. There are two PCI-E X16 slots, one PCI-E X1 slot, four SATA III ports, and two M.2 slots for storage on this motherboard.


          Regarding the motherboard's VRM, it is safe to conclude that, even when mildly overclocked, this motherboard can support **AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or even 3800X** processors with ease. With this motherboard and an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X processor, you may overclock the processor to its maximum performance without having to worry about damaging the VRM. Although, if you intend to replace the processor to an **AMD Ryzen 9 3900X** or above, it will be wiser to switch the motherboard later.The Asrock B450M Pro4 motherboard is a low-cost option that offers enough ports and slots to meet the demands of high-end gamers. Since this motherboard doesn't come with a high-end sound card, audiophiles would be better off spending money on an external one.
    pros:
      - pro: Excellent value for the money
      - pro: Excellent value for the money
    cons:
      - con: Poor audio chipset performance

          The **MSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX,** which is a modification of the earlier
          **B450 TOMAHAWK** motherboard that supports 3rd generation AMD Ryzen
          CPUs out of the box, is the finest b450 **motherboard for ryzen 5
          3600X.** Previously, in order to use the third generation processors,
          you had to change the motherboard's BIOS. The motherboard has a
          similar layout to the original TOMAHAWK, except it is slightly darker
          in colour. The majority of the motherboard is black, with a tiny bit
          of grey hue here and there. On the right side of the laptop, there is
          RGB illumination.You would be alright even if you upgraded your Ryzen
          5 3600X because the motherboard's VRM is capable of handling powerful
          CPUs.


          The motherboard has four DIMM slots, and it now supports speeds up to 4000 MHz, whereas TOMAHAWK only supported RAM sticks running at about 3433 MHz. The motherboard has five PCI-E slots, two of which are PCI-E X16 slots while the other three are PCI-E X1 slots. The **MSI TOMAHAWK MAX** offers six 6Gbps SATA III ports for storage. Additionally, it has an M.2 slot for an SSD drive that runs at a high speed.6 x 3.5mm audio jacks, 1 x USB  3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, an RJ45 port, an HDMI port, a DVI-D port, a PS/2 port, 2 x USB 2.0 ports, and a BIOS button make up the motherboard's I/O.


          The B450 chipset does not support PCI-E 4.0, despite the fact that this motherboard's memory performance is substantially superior than that of earlier B450-based motherboards. This motherboard's BIOS chip is 32MB in capacity, compared to the 16MB BIOS chip on the original TOMAHAWK motherboard. This prevents the manufacturer from having to stop supporting older processors by allowing the user to update the chip to the most recent versions without any issues. Overall, **MSI B450 TOMAHAWK MAX** is the finest motherboard for the Ryzen 5 3600x processor because it comes pre-configured to support third-generation processors, offers excellent memory performance, and has a strong VRM that can handle processors with a high TDP.
    pros:
      - pro: impressive memory capacity
      - pro: Support for third-generation processors out of the box
      - pro: Overclocking performance outperforms other B450 models.
    cons:
      - con: there was some RGB lights.
