## How to choose the right motherboard with Wifi?

To choose a WiFi motherboard, you are advised to pay particular attention to essential parameters.

## 1. Your motherboard's Wi-Fi generation

The Wifi motherboard is a hardware developed to allow you to enjoy a wireless internet connection. To ensure the quality of the connection, it is important to focus on the generation of Wifi. On the market, you have the opportunity to discover different generations of Wifi. They differ from each other by the speed it carries and the stability of the network. Wifi 6 is the most recent generation. With its advanced technologies, this generation offers excellent velocity and great stability.

## 2. The performance of the motherboard box with Wifi

It is also important for you to take into consideration the performance of your box when choosing your WiFi motherboard. It would be a shame to bet on an ultra-fast WiFi motherboard if the speed provided by your box is low. The performance of your box must therefore match that of your Wifi motherboard to provide its full potential. However, you are required to take a good look at your network environment. The distance between your b550 Wifi motherboard and your box should also be taken into consideration. Your performance will be improved depending on your motherboard size. Choose an ATX motherboard or a Micro ATX motherboard.

## 3. The socket

When choosing your WiFi gaming motherboard, don't forget to focus on the socket. Indeed, the socket is a kind of bridge between the processor and the motherboard. This receptacle must be compatible with your processor. In addition to the Wifi connection, you must ensure that your Wifi motherboard can carry a suitable processor that meets your needs. Most WiFi motherboards are used for online gaming, so they must be accompanied by a high-performance and powerful processor.

## 4. Connectivity

It is also wiser to pay particular attention to the connectors of your Wifi motherboard. You need to make sure that it can be connected with different devices that will be useful to you. To accommodate a good number of quality components, make sure that it has PCI-Express ports. Thus, you could use graphics cards, sound cards, USB cards... SAT-A connectors are also preferred to ensure the installation of SSD or HDD hard drives. Do not omit the rear panel ports for installing keyboard, mouse, printer and other peripheral devices. If possible, also promote the presence of Ethernet to serve as an alternative to your Wifi motherboard in case of unforeseen circumstances.

## How to properly use your motherboard with Wifi?

The Wifi motherboard is a piece of equipment that requires good handling to ensure its proper functioning and guarantee its long life. Indeed, false manipulations can cause the deterioration of your equipment. In this section, we present the actions to take to ensure the proper use of your WiFi motherboard.

## 1.Getting to Know Your Wifi Motherboard

Proper handling of your WiFi motherboard generally involves understanding how it works and how to handle it. To do this, you are advised to read your user manual carefully and rely on the instructions and directives assigned therein. It is important to know that your Wifi motherboard must be accompanied by this little booklet on delivery. If your user manual is not provided with your Wifi motherboard, you can contact the seller or the manufacturer. Depending on the brand, the parameters are not the same. Check out our guides to Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI motherboards.

## 2. Choosing the right location for your Wifi motherboard

It is not a question of choosing the location of the Wifi motherboard in the case, it already has a place which is specially dedicated to it. It is above all a question of selecting the right distance between your Wifi motherboard (more precisely your computer) and your Wifi box. You should not install your computer far from your Wifi box so that there is no interference and so that the signal is not altered. Indeed, in the event that you place your box on the ground floor and your PC on the first floor, the speed of the internet connection may be low. Insofar as you are looking for a speed of connection, the ideal is to put the box near your computer.

## 3.Ensure a good cooling system

It is important to know that the Wifi motherboard has components that generate a lot of heat. When the temperature of your Wifi motherboard is high, it can cause the deterioration of the elements of the Wifi motherboard, the card itself or the computer. To avoid this kind of problem, you are advised to check the cooling system. In general, the models that come with your WiFi motherboard are standard equipment. You have the option to change them to more efficient grinds for safe use.
