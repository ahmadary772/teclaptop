          This motherboard is in our favor for many reasons.


          Its performance is quite up to the level of the range. The Z590 motherboard has developed connectivity, notably offering a dual 2.5 Gb Ethernet port as well as two other Thunderbolt 4 ports. In addition, the four ports for SSDs are welcome as part of a scalable config. The ASUS Z590 also allows you to indulge in overclocking, which can be managed by artificial intelligence. Personally, I recommend that you switch to manual instead, because the Adaptive Boost Technology mode certainly boosts performance, but in return for higher temperatures.


          Moreover, speaking of temperatures, I want to highlight the efficient heat dissipation of this model. Asus relies on artificial intelligence to regulate the speed of the fans and thus frankly reduce noise pollution.


          A word, finally, on the design. I find it very elaborate, with an aluminum heat sink that is still quite imposing. The finishes are of high quality and give a neat appearance to the whole, for example for the logo. This one is RGB, so you can enjoy stylish effects and colors. It's a little extra in the context of an open tower or with transparent glass. However, big regret: no backplate, while many manufacturers do in this pricing bracket.


          In short, in my opinion, this is the best Z590 motherboard available on the market, although it obviously comes at a high price.
    pros:
      - pro: Its connectivity (2.5 Gb Ethernet, Thunderbolt 4, etc.)
      - pro: Beautiful aesthetic; the finishes and the ROG RGB logo
      - pro: Good manual overclocking possibilities
      - pro: Smart cooling
    cons:
      - con: The high price
      - con: Lack of backplate
  - name: ASUS Z590 TUF Gaming Plus Wifi
    specifications:
      - specification: >-
          Features :


          Chipset: Z590 | Memory: 4x DIMM, 128GB, DDR4-5133 | PCIe port: 1 x PCIe 4.0 + 1 x PCIe 3.0 (x16) + 2 x PCIe 3.0 (1x) | Video Output: 1x HDMI 2.0 | USB Ports: 2 X USB 2.0 + 2 X USB 3.0+ 2 X USB 3.1 | Networks: 2x 2.5GbE Ethernet, 1x Wi-Fi 6 AX | Storage: 2 X M.2 – PCI-E 3.0 4x + SATA 6 Gb/s + 1 X M.2 – PCI-E 4.0 4x
    pros:
      - pro: Its quality construction
      - pro: The complete connection
      - pro: The attractive price-performance ratio
      - pro: Good cooling performance
    cons:
      - con: Fewer USB ports than desired
      - con: For Intel only

          Available at a more affordable price, this Z590 motherboard is very
          interesting. It comes with a worked design, the white plate at the
          front had its little effect. The motherboard even comes with RGB,
          which will delight gamers with an open tower or with transparent
          glass.


          In terms of connections, I find it really not bad. There are therefore several USB ports, including a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 port, two previous generation ports, 5 USB 3.1 Gen 1 and, finally, 6 USB 2.0 ports. So there are enough inputs for multiple devices. In addition, there is an HDMI port and a DisplayPort 1.4. For storage, there are 3 M.2 ports and 6 SATA ports. It is therefore complete in my eyes, even if it appears that the position of the SATA ports is not optimal for cable management.


          In terms of performance, I'm quite amazed, especially, once again, given the price. In game and in application, the Z590 Asus Tuf Gaming Plus motherboard does well. For overclocking, we certainly have the Adaptive Boost, but again, I recommend rather to proceed manually if you know how to do it. From this perspective, cooling is better managed; moreover, the motherboard has the appropriate technologies to determine the power of the fans in an optimal way.


          In short, in my opinion, this Z590 motherboard is certainly not the best, but if you are looking for a solid and affordable option, this is the reference for you!

          Here is another top-of-the-range reference that is in direct
          competition with our top 1. With an initial price of almost 400 euros,
          this ASUS Z590 motherboard must be beyond reproach.


          We start with the connection, which is undoubtedly an asset of this model. You have a total of 17 USB ports, 10 on the back and 7 on the front. Among them, I find in particular two USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 ports, for optimal transfer speeds. I'm also glad to have the Thunderbolt port back. For the rest, it remains classic, with the HDMI, the DP and the pins for the fans. There are two PCIe 4.0 ports, I would have liked to have one more; the same for PCIe 3.0, which is limited to 3 ports.


          When it comes to performance, I find it lives up to its promises. Stress tests as well as in-game tests give good results, but it is necessary to exploit a good config to extract the full potential of the Z590 motherboard. Therefore, I recommend this motherboard if you have an Intel i9-11900K processor, or want to get one. For overclocking, the dedicated software is interesting, with automatic settings; and don't worry, you have an "Advanced" mode to go further.


          In the end, I find it to be a high-end Z590 motherboard, a good alternative to our top 1. It is however quite niche, due to its performance and high pricing.

      - pro: Rather complete connectivity
      - pro: Advanced overclocking
      - pro: Honorable performances
    cons:
      - con: Single M.2 slot for 10th Gen processors
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: Not all motherboards are suitable for all types of cases, so I've
          chosen a specific model to show you for ITX form factor towers. I
          discover several USB ports, but only one USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 port, and the
          other types of USB are not very numerous either; however, I can't
          expect much from a motherboard for ITX. In game as in application, the
          performances are good. You also have several modes for overclocking,
          even if you are limited in your possibilities because of the
          temperature.

  - name: Asus Prime Z590-P
    specifications:
      - specification: >-
          Features :


          Chipset: Z590 | Memory: 4x DIMM, 128GB, DDR4-5133 | PCIe port: 1 X PCI Express 4.0 16x +1 X PCI Express 4.0 16x (4x) + 2 X PCI Express 3.0 1x | Video Output: 1 x DisplayPort 1.4 + 1 x HDMITM 1.4 / 2.0| USB Ports: 2 X USB 2.0 + 2 X USB 3.0 + 1 X USB 3.1 + 1 X USB 3.2 Type C | Networks: 1x 2.5GbE Ethernet | Storage: 2 X M.2 – PCI-E 3.0 + 4x + SATA 6 Gb/s + 1 X M.2 – PCI-E 4.0 4x + 4 X Serial ATA 6Gb/s (SATA Revision 3)
    pros:
      - pro: The quality of construction and finishes
      - pro: The good performance
      - pro: 2.5 Gb Ethernet
      - pro: An attractive price
    cons:
      - con: Its limited connectivity
      - con: The lack of features
      - con: No Wi-Fi
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          To conclude this comparison of Z590 motherboards, I wanted to present
          something more "budget-friendly". You still get Asus build quality but
          at a more reasonable price. Inevitably, the connection is more
          limited, with a single USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 port and few other ports, but
          you have what you need. We also benefit from 2.5 Gb Ethernet, even if
          the functionalities are limited: there is thus no support for SLI or
          CrossFire.


          A Z590 motherboard that goes to the essentials, at an affordable price in my opinion!

## Why choose a Z590 motherboard rather than Z490?

Since this new generation is an evolution compared to the old one, you can imagine that the Z590 motherboard is more efficient. It natively supports PCIe 4.0 and has x20 PCIE **lanes against x16 for the Z490.**

Transfer speeds are also boosted, thanks to second-generation USB 3.2 connectivity (up to three ports), supporting up to 20 Gb/s, and even double that for motherboards equipped with Thunderbolt technology. For the first generation USB 3.2, supporting up to 10 Gb / s, the Z590 can go up to 10 ports against 6 for the Z490.

If you still don't know which to choose between the Z590 and the Z490, we have written a complete article on the subject, where we compare the two chipsets in detail.



## What are the criteria for finding the best Z590 motherboard?

It is time that I detail you – quickly – the criteria that I took into account to establish the comparison.

## socket

This is definitely the first point you need to focus on, because the socket connects motherboard and CPU. However, not all motherboards are compatible with all processors, so remember to check so you don't end up with an unnecessary purchase and unusable hardware. For 10th and 11th generation Rocket Lake processors, the LGA 1200 port is compatible, and it has the advantage of being present on all Z590 motherboards.

## The “form factor”

More simply, I am talking here about the type of motherboard, namely the dimensions. A motherboard made for an E-ATX case won't fit in a Mini-ITX, for example, so that's another point you need to consider.

## What budget to buy the best Z590 motherboard?

The bill is a little higher in Europe than on the other side of the Atlantic, where prices start around 130 dollars. Here, for the Asus Prime Z590-P motherboard (the most affordable I remember), you can count at least 180 euros. For more sophisticated models, however, the pricing goes up: you will have to pay more than 280 euros for the best Z590 motherboard, the ROG Maximus XIII Hero. Of course, the semiconductor crisis doesn't help, so prices are more important, even if you can compete with resellers. However, since you have to invest in a motherboard anyway, I definitely recommend a Z590, for the extra speeds and new features it brings.
