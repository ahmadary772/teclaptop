      The motherboard is like the brain of a computer: it is the one that manages all the components, their interactions and their proper functioning. Inevitably, choosing a good reference is therefore essential in the assembly of your gaming PC. I present to you for this purpose a comparison of the best Z590 motherboards.


      I give you the first three references in detail, then do a quick update on the next two products.

          This motherboard is in our favor for many reasons.


          Its performance is quite up to the level of the range. The Z590 motherboard has developed connectivity, notably offering a dual 2.5 Gb Ethernet port as well as two other Thunderbolt 4 ports. In addition, the four ports for SSDs are welcome as part of a scalable config. The ASUS Z590 also allows you to indulge in overclocking, which can be managed by artificial intelligence. Personally, I recommend that you switch to manual instead, because the Adaptive Boost Technology mode certainly boosts performance, but in return for higher temperatures.


          Moreover, speaking of temperatures, I want to highlight the efficient heat dissipation of this model. Asus relies on artificial intelligence to regulate the speed of the fans and thus frankly reduce noise pollution.


          A word, finally, on the design. I find it very elaborate, with an aluminum heat sink that is still quite imposing. The finishes are of high quality and give a neat appearance to the whole, for example for the logo. This one is RGB, so you can enjoy stylish effects and colors. It's a little extra in the context of an open tower or with transparent glass. However, big regret: no backplate, while many manufacturers do in this pricing bracket.


          In short, in my opinion, this is the best Z590 motherboard available on the market, although it obviously comes at a high price.
    pros:
      - pro: Its connectivity (2.5 Gb Ethernet, Thunderbolt 4, etc.)
      - pro: Beautiful aesthetic; the finishes and the ROG RGB logo
      - pro: Good manual overclocking possibilities
      - pro: Smart cooling
    cons:
      - con: The high price
      - con: Lack of backplate

What are the criteria for finding the best Z590 motherboard?

It is time that I detail you – quickly – the criteria that I took into account to establish the comparison.

the socket

This is definitely the first point you need to focus on, because the socket connects motherboard and CPU. However, not all motherboards are compatible with all processors, so remember to check so you don't end up with an unnecessary purchase and unusable hardware. For 10th and 11th generation Rocket Lake processors, the LGA 1200 port is compatible, and it has the advantage of being present on all Z590 motherboards.

The “form factor”

More simply, I am talking here about the type of motherboard, namely the dimensions. A motherboard made for an E-ATX case won't fit in a Mini-ITX, for example, so that's another point you need to consider.

What budget to buy the best Z590 motherboard?

The bill is a little higher in Europe than on the other side of the Atlantic, where prices start around 130 dollars. Here, for the Asus Prime Z590-P motherboard (the most affordable I remember), you can count at least 180 euros. For more sophisticated models, however, the pricing goes up: you will have to pay more than 280 euros for the best Z590 motherboard, the ROG Maximus XIII Hero. Of course, the semiconductor crisis doesn't help, so prices are more important, even if you can compete with resellers. However, since you have to invest in a motherboard anyway, I definitely recommend a Z590, for the extra speeds and new features it brings.
