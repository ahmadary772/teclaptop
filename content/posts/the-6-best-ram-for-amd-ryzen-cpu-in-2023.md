      Do you have a PC with an AMD processor or are you building a custom PC and
      looking to optimize choices and costs? It is true that the choice of RAM
      is crucial to make a PC that holds up well, whether in office automation,
      gaming or even as a high-end workstation.


      We therefore offer you two small selections of RAM for AMD processors. We start with a small top of RAM for AMD gaming-oriented PCs. We continue with other AMD compatible RAM models to know.


      After these two selections, we offer you a small summary of the things you need to know to choose your AMD compatible RAM without making any mistakes. If you don't know much about RAM, take your time and read the end of the article carefully before making a decision.


      ## The best RAM for a gaming-oriented AMD PC


      We therefore assume that everything is clear in your mind, and we allow ourselves to start the article by offering you a selection of the best RAMs for AMD processors in order to make a gaming PC. First of all, let's remember here the essentials to know about the choice of RAM for PC gaming. You should know that in this situation, the best is often to aim for 16 GB of storage with 3200 MHz of frequency in dual, all in DDR4 when possible.

          A RAM that has the advantage of presenting a **great quality** / price
          ratio. It is no coincidence that I have selected it several times in
          my configs offered on the site!


          For around 80€, we have here the ideal for an AMD compatible RAM in gaming: **twice 8 GB at 3200 MHz with a very correct CL of 16.**


          This is the most reasonable choice, although it will probably lack design fantasy for some of you. Be aware, however, that there is a model in white that is a little more original.

          as the previous model, while having an adjustable RGB design via a
          majority of software such as Asus Aura, MSI Mystic Light, or Gigabyte
          AORUS Graphics Engine.

          We continue our selection of gaming-oriented AMD PC RAM with the
          **G.Skill Trident Z Royal 2 x 16 GB DDR4 3600 MHz CL16**. What strikes
          above all with it is of course its very inspired and inspiring design.
          The silver color coupled with the crystal/LED effect gives it a very
          special style, and recognizable between 1000.


          It's perfect when you want to make a PC as beautiful as it is powerful. Especially since his abilities are excellent. We are simply at the top of the basket of what we can choose for an AMD gaming PC currently. **32 GB** of capacity at a **frequency of 3600 MHz,** with despite everything a good CL16 latency…


          This is the kind of choice that will make the difference in the long run. Even if obviously, you have to pay a little expensive for such a product… It currently costs a little more than 250€.

          It would have been difficult to mention the best AMD compatible RAM
          for a PC with gaming optics without mentioning the **Corsair Vengeance
          LPX Black DDR4 2 x 8 GB 3200 MHz CAS 16**... And this for a very
          simple reason: this model is in the heads of sales for a while,
          despite a slightly higher price than my Ballistix. Concretely, it is
          available around 100€ currently by looking carefully.


          Two explanations for these excellent sales. The sober and recognizable design is easy to catch the eye. But above all, the integrated aluminum heatsink and 8-layer PCB provide excellent cooling capabilities.


          This is no coincidence, it must be said that it was partly designed to optimize overclocking.

## Key questions to ask yourself before choosing

You now know the main RAM models to remember to make yourself an AMD PC. But before rushing headlong into an online store to buy your RAM, there are a few essential questions to ask yourself.

Without this, you risk buying incompatible modules, or paying a lot without necessarily taking full advantage of the capacities of your RAM.

## What RAM capacity to choose for a Ryzen config?

To store its data, a RAM module has a well-defined capacity. This is expressed in GB. Unsurprisingly, the higher the capacity, the faster the RAM is able to provide a large amount of data to the processor.

But note that it is not necessary to choose the highest capacity to optimize its configuration. Indeed, depending on the uses, the recommended capacities will not be the same.

It is therefore necessary above all to know that for a PC for office automation and multimedia playback, there is no point in aiming too high. As a general rule, a capacity between 8 and 16 GB is more than enough.

For a gaming PC, we generally recommend around 16 GB of storage. Of course, to be quiet for a while, or when you come across a good deal, you can opt for more. 32 GB for example. Especially since the vast majority of AMD processors and motherboards support up to 128 GB.

But at the moment, capacities of 32 GB and above are only useful for large workstations and for PCs used for complex tasks such as video and 3D modeling.

## Which RAM frequency to choose for Ryzen CPU?

Here we enter the heart of the problematic situation when we want to find the ideal RAM for an AMD processor: the frequency.

Indeed, so far, our questions have been quickly answered. Most users should opt for DDR4. For a gamer, the ideal spot is 16 GB.

But when it comes to frequency, things get a bit tricky. Indeed, everything depends on the RAM management capabilities of your processor and your motherboard. Here, you must therefore take care to check the compatibility with your equipment before making your choice. Be aware that most current AMD products support RAM over 4000 Mhz. However, this is more than enough in most cases. Indeed, the ideal frequencies are slightly lower. Thus, for a high-level gaming PC, the recommended frequency is generally 3200 MHz. But for a cheaper PC and especially for office use, you can generally opt for a lower frequency (2400 MHz, 2666 MHz, 3000 MHz) without suffering the consequences.

To learn more, I invite you to read Carl's article on this subject.

## The last details to settle!

To finalize your choice, you still have a few small points to clarify.

The aesthetic aspect has a role to play, especially when you have a glass tower. A beautiful RGB bar can thus make the difference for amateurs.

Also note that contrary to what one might think, RAM performance is optimized when used in dual mode. Better to take two similar 8GB bars than one 16GB!

Finally, in the RAM descriptions, the letters CL appear followed by a number. This is the CAS Latency, in other words the time it takes for the processor to reach the stored data. In the case of two equivalent models, it is therefore better to take the lower CL, even if the difference is not necessarily obvious.
