      A newcomer to the PC component market, DDR5 RAM is likely to change the
      game considerably in the months to come. But let's say it right away, the
      prices are still high, given that the format is brand new. The health
      situation and shortages of raw materials are not helping matters either.


      But if you already want to take the plunge and switch to DDR5, we already offer you a selection of the best models available through a small top 5. Top quality, worked design, inexpensive, good value for money... There is something for every taste !


      After that, I offer you a short buying guide, explaining everything you need to know if you want to buy one of the kits from our selection.


      In any case, if some characteristics of RAM, especially DDR5, and if the news is not clear to you, read the end of the article carefully before committing

          We start this selection with a real monster, the **G.Skill Trident Z5
          RGB Silver kit** – **2 x 16 GB** **(32 GB) – DDR5 6000 MHz – CL40**.


          In terms of technical characteristics, we can already see that it will satisfy the most demanding. The **32 GB (2X16) with a beautiful frequency of 6000 Mhz** and a fairly exceptional CL at 36 in DDR5 ensure us of foolproof liveliness, whether in game or in application.


          On the design side, RGB lovers will be served, with a fairly elegant light touch at the top of two silver bars of the most beautiful effect.


          Unfortunately, you have to pay a high price to take advantage of all these advantages. The kit is currently available around 510€.

  - name: "Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 5200 MHz "
    specifications:
      - specification: |-
          * **Capacity:** 16 GB
          * **Frequency**: 5200MHz
          * **CAS Latency:** CL40
          * **RGB:** No

          We continue our selection with a good, relatively affordable DDR5
          model, the **Kingston Fury Beast – 1 x 16 GB – DDR5 5200 MHz – CL40.**
          Here, you will therefore only have a single 16 GB module, which is
          still sufficient in a lot of cases, in particular for a gaming config.
          It's perfect for setting foot in DDR5 without breaking the bank
          despite the situation.


          The concessions to be made are not too great. The **frequency of 5200 Mhz** is already well above what can be had with DDR4… The **CL40** latency is in the average of current DDR5. Only the slightly sad design will leave you with an aftertaste of frustration.


          Note that there is a relatively similar model from the same brand, the Kingston Fury Beast – 1 x 16 GB – DDR5 4800 MHz – CL38. For around $5 less, you'll get the same capabilities with a slightly lower frequency but better latency. In our opinion, this choice will ultimately be less relevant in terms of performance and the slight saving that can be made is anecdotal. Between 185€ and 190€ approximately, it is better to opt for a better frequency.

          * **CAS Latency**: CL40
          * **RGB:** No
    pros:

      - pro: Good capacity
      - pro: Nice design
    cons:
      - con: A bit high latency

      - paragraph: >-
          Now let's move on to a model to consider if you want to achieve a good
          compromise between quality and price. For a good value for money, we
          have selected the **G.Skill Ripjaws S5 White kit – 2 x 16 GB (32 GB) –
          DDR5 5200 MHz – CL40.**


          Available for around €380, it allows you to obtain **32 GB (2X16) with a good frequency of 5200 Mhz** and a correct **latency time of 40**. In short, for only twice the price of the cheapest bar in our selection , we have twice as much capacity with the same frequencies and latency.


          This therefore makes it possible to take advantage of an always “affordable” price to be able to anticipate the future much more serenely. Provided, of course, that you can invest today!
  - name: Corsair Dominator Platinum DDR5 32 Go

    specifications:
      - specification: |-
          * **Capacity:** 32 GB (2X16)
          * **Frequency:** 5200MHz
          * **CAS Latency:** CL38
          * **RGB:** Yes
    pros:
      - pro: Design
      - pro: Capacity in the high average in DDR5
    cons:
      - con: the price
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          We continue our selection of **DDR5 kits** with the **Corsair
          Dominator Platinum DDR5 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) 5200 MHz CL38**. Already
          quite popular, it was above all noticed by a particularly worked
          design, with a small RGB strip of the most beautiful effect.


          As for his abilities, they are also appreciable. The **32 GB (2X16) with 5200 MHz frequency** and CL38 latency time will allow you to face the future serenely both in game and in applications. We even slightly exceed the kit with the best quality/price ratio of the selection with lower latency.


          But it is at the level of the price that the shoe pinches. The design is relatively expensive. This kit is currently available for around €445.
  - name: Kingston ValueRAM 16 Go DDR5 4800 MHz
    image: /uploads/kingston-valueram-16-go-ddr5-4800-mhz.jpg
    specifications:
      - specification: |-
          * **Capacity:** 16 GB
          * **Frequency:** 4800MHz
          * **CAS Latency:** CL40
          * **RGB:** No
    pros:
      - pro: Unbeatable price today
    cons:
      - con: Many concessions to make to save a few tens of euros
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          Let's finish our selection with a “borderline” case. This is the
          **Kingston ValueRAM 16 GB DDR5** **4800 MHz CL40**. Here, the main
          argument is clearly the price. It is quite simply the cheapest DDR5
          proposition currently on the market. It is available for around €178.


          With it, you can therefore have DDR5 for a little more than 10€ less than our favorite inexpensive model, the **Kingston Fury Beast – 1 x 16 GB (16 GB) – DDR5 5200 MHz – CL40.**


          To earn these €10, you will have to agree to have a lower frequency of 4800 MHz, and therefore to lose 400 MHz.


          Let's say it clearly. In our opinion, this choice will not necessarily be very wise. If your budget is really limited, it may be better to wait for the prices to drop. Normally, this shouldn't take too long despite the current situation. But if you are particularly in a hurry and your budget is close to 10€… Well, why not. You will already be able to take advantage of the capabilities of DDR5. This is the main !

## How to choose your RAM: a short buying guide

## Which capacity to choose?

The first question to ask when choosing your RAM is the question of capacity. The number of GB indicated on the description simply corresponds to the volume of data that can be stored on a strip for almost immediate use.

Depending on the uses, the needs will not necessarily be the same. In gaming, we currently recommend having 16 GB of RAM, 32 being the best. Higher capacities are currently recommended for high-level applications or multitasking. If you stream AAA in QHD in particular, you may need 64 GB.

But let's be prepared. With the new DDR5 format, and the new models of chipsets that follow one another, especially at Intel, our habits are likely to be quickly turned upside down. Developers should quickly take advantage of all these new possibilities to offer us better games and better apps.

## What frequency should you aim for?

The frequency, expressed in MHz, refers to the speed at which the RAM can process the stored data. Thus, the higher the frequency, the greater the performance of the RAM. This is especially true in applications. In the context of the game, a slight difference in frequency will generally remain anecdotal in terms of FPS. As far as the beauty of the game is concerned, this changes absolutely nothing. For the moment, the spot to aim for the game is around 3200 MHz.

## What latency to accept?

Commonly referred to as CL, latency is the time it takes for the processor to reach the data stored by RAM. Logically, the lower the cadence, the better. But once again, in game the differences will not necessarily be obvious.

## What you need to know before buying your DDR5

## A format still difficult to access

There is one extremely important thing to keep in mind before buying your DDR5. Currently, there are very few computers compatible with this format. Indeed, only computers with a compatible Intel 600 series motherboard with a 12th generation Alder Lake processor support this format. However, this new generation of processors has just been released. For AMD hardware, we have to wait for the new Zen 4 processors, in the Ryzen 7000 series. They should be released between the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2022.

Of course, there's no need to rush to DDR5 if you don't have a compatible computer.

## Very high prices for still restrained results

Let's not beat around the bush. According to the experts, the most reasonable thing is to wait a little longer before buying DDR5. And those for several reasons.

To begin with, as you have seen in our selection, the prices are still very high. Even the manufacturer MSI says it: the prices of the new generation of RAM format are particularly high due to the presence of new components. We therefore have to pay an average of 60% more for DDR5. However, still according to the brand, prices will be similar to those of the previous generation DDR4 in about 2 years.

Then, know that for the moment, the first modules to install DDR5 are not yet able to fully use the potential of DDR5. As a result, we end up with lower performance for high prices.

Finally, the DDR5 kits currently available are not yet able to offer us all that DDR5 will be able to bring in the months to come. The technology is still in its infancy, and everything will gradually improve.

If you are not particularly in a hurry and if you do not have a huge budget, the wisest thing is probably to take your troubles patiently. You will have both the advantage of paying less and taking full advantage of the capabilities of your kit.

## For further

Now you know a little more about DDR5, and the best models to watch out for, or even buy. If you want to go further, in particular on the real capacities of DDR5 and on the advances compared to the previous generation, do not hesitate to read my comparison between these two formats!
