      A newcomer to the PC component market, DDR5 RAM is likely to change the
      game considerably in the months to come. But let's say it right away, the
      prices are still high, given that the format is brand new. The health
      situation and shortages of raw materials are not helping matters either.


      But if you already want to take the plunge and switch to DDR5, we already offer you a selection of the best models available through a small top 5. Top quality, worked design, inexpensive, good value for money... There is something for every taste !


      After that, I offer you a short buying guide, explaining everything you need to know if you want to buy one of the kits from our selection.


      In any case, if some characteristics of RAM, especially DDR5, and if the news is not clear to you, read the end of the article carefully before committing

          We start this selection with a real monster, the G.Skill Trident Z5
          RGB Silver kit – 2 x 16 GB (32 GB) – DDR5 6000 MHz – CL40.


          In terms of technical characteristics, we can already see that it will satisfy the most demanding. The 32 GB (2X16) with a beautiful frequency of 6000 Mhz and a fairly exceptional CL at 36 in DDR5 ensure us of foolproof liveliness, whether in game or in application.


          On the design side, RGB lovers will be served, with a fairly elegant light touch at the top of two silver bars of the most beautiful effect.


          Unfortunately, you have to pay a high price to take advantage of all these advantages. The kit is currently available around 510€.

## How to choose your RAM: a short buying guide

## Which capacity to choose?

The first question to ask when choosing your RAM is the question of capacity. The number of GB indicated on the description simply corresponds to the volume of data that can be stored on a strip for almost immediate use.

Depending on the uses, the needs will not necessarily be the same. In gaming, we currently recommend having 16 GB of RAM, 32 being the best. Higher capacities are currently recommended for high-level applications or multitasking. If you stream AAA in QHD in particular, you may need 64 GB.

But let's be prepared. With the new DDR5 format, and the new models of chipsets that follow one another, especially at Intel, our habits are likely to be quickly turned upside down. Developers should quickly take advantage of all these new possibilities to offer us better games and better apps.

## What frequency should you aim for?

The frequency, expressed in MHz, refers to the speed at which the RAM can process the stored data. Thus, the higher the frequency, the greater the performance of the RAM. This is especially true in applications. In the context of the game, a slight difference in frequency will generally remain anecdotal in terms of FPS. As far as the beauty of the game is concerned, this changes absolutely nothing. For the moment, the spot to aim for the game is around 3200 MHz.

## What latency to accept?

Commonly referred to as CL, latency is the time it takes for the processor to reach the data stored by RAM. Logically, the lower the cadence, the better. But once again, in game the differences will not necessarily be obvious.

## What you need to know before buying your DDR5

## A format still difficult to access

There is one extremely important thing to keep in mind before buying your DDR5. Currently, there are very few computers compatible with this format. Indeed, only computers with a compatible Intel 600 series motherboard with a 12th generation Alder Lake processor support this format. However, this new generation of processors has just been released. For AMD hardware, we have to wait for the new Zen 4 processors, in the Ryzen 7000 series. They should be released between the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2022.

Of course, there's no need to rush to DDR5 if you don't have a compatible computer.

## Very high prices for still restrained results

Let's not beat around the bush. According to the experts, the most reasonable thing is to wait a little longer before buying DDR5. And those for several reasons.

To begin with, as you have seen in our selection, the prices are still very high. Even the manufacturer MSI says it: the prices of the new generation of RAM format are particularly high due to the presence of new components. We therefore have to pay an average of 60% more for DDR5. However, still according to the brand, prices will be similar to those of the previous generation DDR4 in about 2 years.

Then, know that for the moment, the first modules to install DDR5 are not yet able to fully use the potential of DDR5. As a result, we end up with lower performance for high prices.

Finally, the DDR5 kits currently available are not yet able to offer us all that DDR5 will be able to bring in the months to come. The technology is still in its infancy, and everything will gradually improve.

If you are not particularly in a hurry and if you do not have a huge budget, the wisest thing is probably to take your troubles patiently. You will have both the advantage of paying less and taking full advantage of the capabilities of your kit.

## For further

Now you know a little more about DDR5, and the best models to watch out for, or even buy. If you want to go further, in particular on the real capacities of DDR5 and on the advances compared to the previous generation, do not hesitate to read my comparison between these two formats!
