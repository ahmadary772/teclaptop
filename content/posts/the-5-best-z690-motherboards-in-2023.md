      Not so long ago, we offered you a comparison between two Intel chipsets,
      the Z590 and the B560. There was already a lot to say about them, but at
      the end of 2021 the news has accelerated considerably on the Intel side.
      The release of a new range of processors, the 12th generation Alder Lake
      has once again changed the game. It must be said that these processors are
      compatible with a brand new socket, the Intel 1700. This new generation of
      processors is therefore accompanied by a new chipset with a compatible
      socket, the Z690.


      If you want to take advantage of these latest Intel releases to make yourself a new custom-made PC, we therefore offer you a selection of the best Z690 motherboard models here.


      Top-of-the-range, small format, low budget, good value for money… There is something for everyone.

          We start with the most powerful Z690 of our selection: the ASUS ROG
          Maximus Z690 Hero WiFi.


          Here, there is absolutely everything you may need for a moment, whether in terms of graphics card connections (the two PCI 5.0 in particular), USB ports, network connections and storage. It just lacks a small DisplayPort to satisfy absolutely everyone.


          The price of around €650 is high, as one might expect.
