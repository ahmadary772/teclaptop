          We are confident that **TUF Gaming Z690-Plus WiFi D4** will become a
          mainstay of this price range, as it offers most of what Alder Lake
          supports without the associated costs. Its VRM is a solid foundation
          for overclocked or high-end mid-range CPUs, the number of connections
          offered is right for the price. Interestingly, ASUS has given up on
          standard RGB headers, opting instead for three ARGBs and an Aura
          header.


          While the appearance changes are questionable, everyone will agree that the VRM and associated heat sinks are much improved. The configuration of the DrMOS 14 + 2 power stage remains the same, but each stage now supplies 80A to the CPU. An additional 4-pin connector can be used for more stable power delivery. On the PCIe front, we have three x16 and two x1 slots, the latter ideal for expansion or capture cards. The upper x16 slot is the only one that supports PCIe 5.0 and with access to all 16 pins. The new chipset allows you to connect a total of four M.2 drives, two of which share a heatsink extended towards the bottom of the board.


          The I / O is not crowded as there are only eight USB sockets available. Fortunately, USB 3.2 Gen1 is the older variant, with two built-in USB-C ports. DisplayPort and HDMI will help gamers who don't mind spending time on CSa: GO using Xe graphics in hopes of overcoming the GPU shortage. There's nothing on I / O to help with overclocking, but you can choose between WiFi6 and 2.5 Gbps Ethernet with LAN Guard.

          The MSI Pro series of motherboards have been synonymous with value and
          reliability for a long time now, and the trend continues with **MSI
          Pro Z690-A motherboards**. We actually find 4 different peripherals
          with the same name, but all with the same PCB differentiated by the
          two generation variables WiFi and DDR. In this particular roundup, we
          recommend the **MSI Pro Z690-A DDR5 WiFi** motherboard as it still
          offers a great price-performance ratio.


          The **MSI Pro Z690-A motherboard** packs a decent 8 + 4 phase VRM which will be great for most regular users who will purchase a motherboard in this price range. The VRM should be able to handle a Core i5 12600K at its maximum overclock, but it should also be able to handle a slight overclocking on its Core i7 sibling. MSI hasn't included any RGB lighting on the board, which is a bit of a pain if you're building a PC in 2022. On the plus side, you don't need to install any RGB bloatware for the motherboard. Support for DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5 comes standard with the Z690 chipset, with 4 M.2 slots and PCIe Gen 4 functionality.


          Rear I / O itself is good with a good selection of USB ports and a 2.5GbE LAN port along with WiFi functionality if that particular motherboard variant is chosen. In conclusion, the **MSI Pro Z690-A** is certainly one of the most value-oriented motherboards on the market and one that puts price-performance first.

          Since the Maximus series isn't something everyone can or should buy,
          ASUS has also released several upper mid-range **motherboards for the
          Z690 platform.** The standard ROG series also offers a choice between
          DDR5 and DDR4 memory configurations, so be sure to purchase the card
          that supports the specific type of memory you plan to install.


          ASUS has packaged a 16 + 1 phase VRM which is pretty good by modern standards. This VRM should be able to comfortably overclock an i7 12700K, as well as be able to achieve some degree of overclocking on the i9 12900K. VRM cooling is also adequate as ASUS has provided large enough heatsinks with diagonal fins to maximize heat dissipation. The RGB design and Strix script on the I / O cover are sublime, giving a glassy look that would fit perfectly in many RGB systems. The chipset heatsink is also white and extends over the PCIe Gen 4 M.2 drive slots as well.


          PCIe Gen 5 support is standard on all **Z690** cards, so it also pops up here, along with support for DDR5 memory up to **5333 MHz**. There are four M.2 slots that support PCIe Gen 4 functionality. connectivity is managed by a 2.5 GbE LAN port and WiFi 6. Several high-speed USB ports are also present on the rear I / O with different speed characteristics. By pairing this motherboard with an i7 12700K or i5 12600K you will have a truly competitive gaming platform.

          Gigabyte's high-end AORUS motherboards recently have been absolutely
          fantastic for both platforms, so it's no surprise that the **Gigabyte
          Z690 AORUS Master** ends up among our picks for the **best high-end
          Z690 motherboar**d. Not only does it have an excellent power delivery
          system that's almost a necessity for new Alder Lake CPUs, but also a
          feature set comparable to some of the more expensive Z690 motherboards
          around.


          The extremely oversized VRM consists of 22 stages, 19 of which supply the 105A CPU with power. This is an insane VRM setup that will almost never be fully utilized, even from a fully overclocked 12900K running 24/7. The VRM design is really ahead of its time due to the fact that any Alder lake, current and future, will fail to saturate the VRM of this motherboard. The heatsinks are quite large, so the card should have no problem dissipating the heat from the VRMs. Speaking of the heatsink, the one on the chipset spans the entire bottom half of the PCB and doubles as a heatsink for M.2 drives. This is a very ingenious implementation.


          When it comes to features, we really have no reason to doubt the **AORUS Master Z690 motherboard**. We find support for DDR5 DIMM memory up to 6400 MHz. There are 11 USB ports on the I / O including two USB-C. The main feature, however, is the 10 GbE LAN port on the back. PCIe Gen 5 is also supported, and the card also has four M.2 drives for every storage need. In conclusion, the AORUS Master Z690 is one of the best premium motherboards for the Z690 chipset available right now.
