      If you are looking for a laptop for streaming in this article I will list
      the 5 laptops most suitable for streaming video games in 2022.


      If you want to know more about each of these laptops and especially why I chose them, in the rest of the article I will go into more detail on each of the models so that you can see which one would be best suited to your needs.


      Finally I will explain at the end of the selection, if none of these PCs suit you, how to choose your future laptops and above all why, if I were in your place, I would not take one.

  - name: ASUS ROG Zephyrus G 14 GA401IV-161T
    nameForTOC: "ASUS ROG Zephyrus G 14 "
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          The **Asus G14** marks AMD's return to the mobile processor segment.
          The 4000 series based on the Zen 2 architecture are a killer in terms
          of performance compared to the competition. With its 8 cores and 16
          Threads of the **Ryzen 7 4800HS** you are ready for the games of the
          future which will easily use these 16 threads thanks to the arrival of
          new generation consoles.


          For productivity it's also great to have these 16 Threads if you ever need to do video editing or some 3D rendering.


          Regarding in-game performance, the CPU is limited by a mid-range GPU, the RTX 2060 (Max-Q). It's far from a bad graphics card, but I wish I had an **RTX 2070 Super or 2080 Super** for maximum performance. This privilege is reserved for 10th generation Intel processors.


          So you have to make concessions on the detail level if you want to reach 60 fps.


          As a result, the performance of this G14 is below the other Intel laptops I have listed. Nevertheless, the performance/price ratio of this PC is excellent. An 8C/16T processor from Intel costs much more than in this configuration.


          Finally, depending on the configuration chosen, you will have **16GB of Ram**, which is sufficient for the moment, and a **1TB NVMe SSD.** You can then upgrade your with more RAM and storage if needed.

  - name: MSI GL75 Leopard 10SER-036FR
    nameForTOC: "MSI GL75 Leopard "
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          The **GL75 from MSI** is somewhat the Intel equivalent of the Asus G14
          in terms of price range. But it will be strangely more efficient than
          the G14.


          Indeed, **despite the 6C/12T of the i7-10750H**, the performance per core of Intel processors remains superior to that of AMD. However, for the moment, games favor the performance of each CPU core individually.


          In addition, the **GL75** comes with an **RTX 2060.** Which is more capable than the RTX 2060 Max-Q of the G14. The difference in performance is significant since the Max Q version is made to consume less and heat less. Giving the de facto advantage to the MSI GL75.


          Therefore in terms of gaming performance this **MSIGL75** is more interesting than the G14. Although I consider the CPU to be inferior to that of the G14.


          6C/12T processors are currently adequate for gaming, but that will change in the coming years. For streaming I would have preferred to have an 8C/16T in order to have a greater performance margin.


          The configuration in terms of RAM and SSD is similar to the G14 that I presented above: **16GB** and a 1TB Nvme SSD of course it depends on the configuration chosen.


          Even if paradoxically, this PC is more efficient than the G14, I would be more inclined to take the latter if you plan to keep this PC as your main machine.

  - name: ASUS ROG STRIX SCAR 15
    nameForTOC: ASUS ROG STRIX SCAR 15
    paragraphs:
      - paragraph: >-
          The **ROG Strix SCAR** is what I would personally take if I wanted to
          stream on a laptop. For me it ticks all the boxes I look for in a
          stream.


          An **RTX 2070** and an octa-core processor (8 cores / 16 threads). The RTX 2070 super is a high-end graphics card capable of playing all recent games without concessions (except with the RTX). The ROG Strix is equipped with a Full HD screen, for an RTX 2070 Super it will be easy to reach 60fps and more.


          The **Core i7-10875H**, is an 8C/16Threads is a good processor for gaming and productivity. It may be a little less efficient than a 4800H or 4900H in productivity, but it will have the advantage in gaming, which interests us as streamers.


          Again it is equipped with a 1**TB NVMe SSD and 16GB of RAM.** Everything can be upgraded in the future which is always good to take.

          If you want to have the best graphics card available on a laptop for
          gaming, the **Acer Predator** T**riton** is a good candidate. It is
          equipped with an **RTX 2080 Super (Max-Q)** it will be less efficient
          than a “normal” 2080 Super but more than a 2070 Super. This PC should
          perform better than the PCs presented previously thanks to its more
          powerful graphics card.


          My only concern with this config is the processor, it's the **i7 10750H** and therefore it has "only" 6 cores and 12 Threads. This is more than enough for gaming in 2020, but the situation may change because of the new consoles.


          Anyway, this 6 cores 16 threads has enough to run any game at max, and anyway it's the graphics card that will be the limiting factor.


          The main advantage of this Acer PC is its price. It is one of the cheapest with an RTX 2080 Super.


          Again we find 16GB of Ram and a 1TB SSD. What good!

          If you want to buy the best in terms of laptops in 2022, this **MSI
          GE75 Raider** is one of the ideal candidates.


          With its **i9-10980HK** an 8-core / 16-thread processor that can go up to **5.3 Ghz** in turbo frequency, it is one of the best gaming processors on the market.


          In addition to that it coupled with an **RTX 2080 Supe**r. Not a Max-Q version but the full version of the 2080 Super mobile.


          With that you have the best gaming configuration in 2020 for a laptop, it will also be very good for streaming.


          In addition, it will be accompanied by **32 GB of Ram and a 1TB NVMe SSD. 32 GB** is what I consider to be the optimal amount of RAM in 2020 for streaming.

## The different versions of these PCs

There is a good chance that you will find directly the same configuration as the ones I propose. This is completely normal, because manufacturers make several versions of the same model. In addition, depending on current promotions, some PCs can become really interesting.

## Which of these laptops is THE best for streaming?

The best for streaming is the MSI GE75. It has the most powerful components for gaming and therefore you will have the best conditions for streaming. But it is also the most expensive and the price displayed is extremely high.

A more reasonable config would be the **ROG STRIX SCAR 15** which has a good 8-core processor and the graphics card just below the 2080 Super. The performance will also be very good at a much more affordable price.

Finally, the price/performance champion is the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14. This is one of the cheapest configs but will also give you a good gaming experience.

## What you need on a laptop to stream in 2022


You may not know it, but streaming requires a lot of resources. Therefore you need to have a certain class of components especially if you want to stream AAA games with advanced graphics.

The way I chose these PCs was therefore quite drastic, because I didn't want you to believe that with an 800€ laptop you will be able to stream Cyberpunk 2077 in 1080p-60fps with everything on the go.

Here are the criteria I used to select the PCs:

* 6c/12t processor minimum, 8c/16t preferred
* Nvidia graphics card with ray-tracing and NVENC
* 16 GB RAM Minimum
* 1TB NVMe SSD drive

  The processor must have a minimum of 6 cores and 12 threads of the latest generation from Intel & AMD for modern games. Developers are increasingly parallelizing games, which means that they can use every core available on today's processors. A processor that does not have enough cores will be greatly penalized in game. You will thus have a lot of jerks even if the average fps are correct. On top of that if you stream, the CPU will simply be overwhelmed by the load, even with NVENC.

  The Nvidia graphics card is mainly there for the NVENC which is the hardware encoder from Nvidia and which allows you to limit the loss of FPS when you stream. In addition you will have the possibility of activating ray-tracing which is the technology of the future for games.

  The 16 GB of DDR4 RAM is a minimum. 32 GB would be better, but you can easily, on all gaming laptops, upgrade the RAM without too much difficulty. So having "only" 16GB is not a problem right away.

  The NVMe SSD disk is essential for the comfort of use but especially for the games of the future which will be based solely on SSDs as a storage disk. Indeed, the PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles will have ultra-fast NVMe SSDs which will radically change the way developers will code their game. Thus we could see games arriving requiring an NVMe SSD to play. Well, this is all just a hypothesis, but I believe that anyway opting for NVMe is worth the cost.

  ## Why you shouldn't...

  I'll be honest with you, I don't think you should buy a laptop for streaming. Here are the reasons:

  ##  price

  If you've looked at my selection, you've probably noticed how steep the bill for some of these machines was. It is not surprising in the world of laptops, the price of machines climbs very quickly if you want to have the latest components.

  This is for me, the first big obstacle. Indeed, in terms of performance / price ratio, a fixed PC will be much more advantageous. With a fixed PC at 1500 € you will already have high-end performance, whereas in my selection it is the minimum for portable PCs in streaming.

  ##  upgrade

  With tower you will have the possibility to change graphics card, RAM processor in short everything you want if you are a little handyman. On laptops, upgrades are limited to RAM and SSDs. Important components like the CPU and GPU are soldered to motherboard PCBs (most often). It is therefore impossible to gain in performance over time.

  ## screen size

  Laptops have 15″, 17″ etc screens, it is enough to play on the go in a hotel room, but to stream you will quickly feel stuck by the lack of available screen. When managing the game, OBS, and the return of the stream having a large screen (27″) is almost a must. Quite quickly you will therefore have to take a PC screen, and from there your laptop will most of the time stick to your desk…

  ## Noise and Heat

  Of all the gaming laptops I've had, none of them have been silent in game...

  At the same time manufacturers cannot circumvent the laws of physics and therefore to properly cool the components they are forced to spin small fans very quickly which generates noise.

  Moreover, even with these fans, the components will reach much higher temperatures than in a well-made desktop PC. However, the lower the temperature of the silicon chips, the better they are. In terms of longevity, a gaming laptop is not as good as a desktop PC precisely because of these high temperatures.

  These are the reasons why I don't buy a laptop for streaming. However, there are scenarios where buying a laptop for streaming can make sense…

## Where to buy a laptop for streaming makes sense

## You are super mobile

If you know that you are going to be very mobile for the next few years of your life, for example if you are a student or an expat, then taking a laptop PC for streaming may be justified. As a student, you will need a laptop for your studies anyway, so having an all-in-one machine is a practical solution. In addition, if you have internships or semesters abroad, your laptop can follow you everywhere. The thing is, you really need to need the mobility.

## You are running out of space at home

A desktop PC takes up space! However, not everyone has the space at home to install an office with a screen and a tower. A laptop can then be a solution that lacks living space.

## You already have a good desktop PC

If you already have a good desktop PC configuration and would like to have a PC powerful enough to accompany you on the go. So I see absolutely no objection to buying a laptop for streaming.

## Conclusion

I've had quite a few portable gaming PCs over the past few years. And I must say that my experience with these machines is quite mixed. It was a time when high-end graphics cards were watered down versions of mid-range desktop cards.

In general, after 2 years, these machines broke down and the performance was no longer really up to par.

Today things have changed quite a bit. The difference in performance between mobile and desktop graphics cards has diminished and mobile processors are no longer lacking (especially on the AMD side) compared to their desktop counterpart.
