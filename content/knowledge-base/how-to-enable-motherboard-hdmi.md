The ease of having a dedicated graphics card in your computer may be enormous, and as of right now, every flagship model includes one. However, the subject of "How to Enable Motherboard HDMI?" is frequently asked. The Radeon Vega graphics, which come with AMD's new Ryzen processors, are the best example of how powerful dedicated graphics cards have evolved in recent years. Because of this specialised graphics card's strength, you can play AAA titles at 1080p resolution on medium to high settings with no lag. They also provide other GPUs from the previous generation with fierce rivalry.

The procedure of switching from your external graphics card to your PC's built-in graphics card is pretty simple; you simply need to enable a few options. The more recent HDMI connectors, which offer a greater resolution and more accurate colour reproduction on the screen, are included on modern motherboards. You can learn everything about how to use HDMI on a motherboard effectively as well as the equipment needed for it in this article. Let's begin, then.

## Verify the Integrated GPU

Checking to see if your PC has a dedicated graphics card is necessary before we can properly use the HDMI port. We must make sure that you have the appropriate CPU for this process because, as was previously indicated, while the majority of contemporary GPUs come with dedicated graphics cards, some do not.

By glancing at the motherboard, you can determine whether your computer has a dedicated GPU the quickest and easiest method possible. Even though it's frequently inaccurate, it might nevertheless offer you a general sense. The likelihood is that your motherboard supports CPUs with integrated graphics cards if it has any display output.

The only thing left to do is check the manufacturer's website for your CPU specifications to see if it includes an integrated graphics card. You can accomplish this by simply opening the system information window on your Windows 10 computer, copying your CPU's name, and then looking it up online. Following that, you can visit the manufacturer's website and look for the phrase "Integrated graphics card supported" or a phrase that sounds similar. If it responds positively, you are in luck; if not, you must keep utilising an external graphic card.

## Activating the IGPU

We can proceed to the next step of turning on your internal graphics card now that we are certain you have one. Again, if you take the right measures, this is not too difficult. If your computer is already running, turn it off and restart it. Press the F10 key or F8 once you see the manufacturer's logo to begin. Remember that the key can vary depending on the manufacturer of your motherboard, but since this key is used by the majority of motherboards, you can start with these two. You must search for the key that enters the motherboard BIOS if your computer won't boot into it.

Start your search for the Integrated Graphics Card Enable option once you have logged into your motherboard's BIOS. You shouldn't be concerned if you don't see one listed as an IGPU because several manufacturers use names similar to this one. However, you should exercise caution because failure may result if you enable the incorrect option. Once you've found it, switch it to on and return to the option to save changes. Your computer will boot normally, just like before, if you choose the option and exit the BIOS.

## Using an HDMI Cable to Connect to a Port

All that's left to do is attach the HDMI cable to your display and computer after everything has been completed. You must first connect the primary HDMI cable to the first display if you're utilising two monitors at once. Once it starts to light up, you can attach the second HDMI cable to the additional HDMI slot and the second display. Installing the proper IGPU drivers is important because if you install drivers that are incompatible with your PC's integrated graphics card, your PC will operate slowly overall.

Due to a shortage of video RAM, high-resolution videos cannot be played. Furthermore, every animation will make your entire PC appear to be slowing down. You can feel the LAG in your computer's windows even when you open or close them. Use only high-quality HDMI cables, as low-quality ones won't be able to identify your monitor and will interfere with its colour profile and other features. Finally, your monitor's resolution will only go as high as 1600x900 and the image processing will be poor.



## How to Use the HDMI Port on a Motherboard

These are a few of the key points related to the question, "How to Enable Motherboard HDMI?" It can be challenging to turn on the GPU via the motherboard BIOS, but once you have, you won't have to put out the same effort because you can quickly turn it off when necessary.
