Not so long ago, only the most passionate people wondered about the temperature of computer components. Once the graphics card was plugged in, the majority just played! The game was running in high, medium or low quality, or it was not running… Over the years, the average user has gained in leeway, but unfortunately there are always more questions to ask. In addition to the more and more precise settings at play, the question of component temperatures is increasingly tormenting us. It is true that the problem is relatively complex…

How high can you upgrade your graphics card without risk?

What is the optimal temperature to make the most of the capabilities of the graphics card without risking overheating?

How to lower the temperature of the GPU?… The subject is vast. We make a complete topo.

**In summary, the optimal temperature for a GPU in game is 80°C, beyond that, we can consider that your GPU begins to overheat. Indeed from 85°C, we will observe a loss in performance due to a drop in operating frequencies (drop on Core Clocks mainly). And therefore any temperature below 80°C under load can be considered acceptable.**

## Graphics card temperature: the basics you need to know

Before answering concretely the question of the optimal temperature of the graphics card, it seems important to me to take stock of certain basics to know to start on the right foot.

## How to check the temperature?

To optimize the temperature of the GPU, the most important thing is obviously to know how to control it correctly. To control the temperature of your computer, there are no 36 solutions. Actually, there are two main ones.

Regarding the GPU, the best solution in my opinion is to use the utility provided directly with the graphics card. The AMD Catalyst Control Center does the job perfectly. A small Alt + Tab during the game to switch to the control panel is usually enough to check that everything is going well.

If you don't have an AMD graphics card, you can also use third-party software such as HWMonitor , MSI Afterburner, or GPU-Z. They have the advantage of providing us with more precise information, in particular by indicating the rotation speed of the fans.

But they also allow you to control the temperature of all PC components at a glance. This makes it much easier to make a diagnosis in the event of a problem.

## A question of context

One last thing I'd like to discuss with you before specifically answering the question at hand, context.

Indeed, depending on whether you are playing on a laptop PC or a desktop PC, depending on the duration of use, depending on the situation, and depending on the temperature of the other components of the computer, the answers and solutions in the event of overheating can vary greatly.

Of course, the ideal temperatures also vary depending on the brand of the graphics card.

To do well, do not keep a single temperature in mind, and always try to keep an overall view of the situation. Remember also that for all the figures that I am going to give you, it is obviously a range, an interval of optimal temperature. No numbers are set in stone!

## How far can we go?

Before even wondering what is the ideal temperature to reach to reconcile performance and durability of equipment, it is essential to know the crucial point that should never be exceeded.

As a general rule, it is estimated that a GPU should not exceed 85°C, except under special conditions . In any case, one thing is certain, from 100°C, you have to start slowing down at all costs. And you should never, ever, exceed 110°C, no matter what!

Indeed, in case of prolonged overheating, the GPU can drop in performance. And that's only the beginning of the problems… Eventually, your equipment could be damaged.

So stay on your guard and don't play sorcerer's apprentice, especially when overclocking.

Besides, if you are looking for a new graphics card, we have made a comparison of the graphics cards of the moment.

## The optimal temperature for a graphics card on a desktop computer

Now that all of that is clear, we can get to the heart of the matter with the ideal temperature for a desktop computer.

To begin, I invite you to consult the manual of your graphics card. Yes, we don't necessarily think about it, but the simplest solutions are sometimes the best.

The designers of your graphics card have studied all these questions upstream, with precision. The wisest thing is often to trust them to enjoy their equipment in the best conditions.

That being said, we can still keep in mind certain ideal temperature ranges, which will allow the vast majority of graphics cards to operate optimally.

Of course, depending on whether you are in play or at rest, the temperatures to aim for will not be the same at all...

At rest, a GPU should have a temperature between approximately 45 and 55°. As a general rule, the temperature to aim for is therefore 50°C. But this is obviously an average. The age of your PC, in particular, can affect the core temperatures of its various components.

In game, graphics cards always take a hit! Here, the ideal temperatures are in the range between 65°C and 85°C. The temperature to aim for is therefore generally around 75°.

## The optimal temperature for a graphics card on a laptop

Second scenario, the laptop. First important thing to know, we generally talk about temperatures that are a little higher on laptops than on desktop computers. Ventilation and heat removal systems are less efficient. Manufacturers know this well, and act accordingly…

Thus, outside the game, we can allow ourselves temperatures slightly higher than those of a desktop PC GPU. Be careful not to go crazy though.

The thermometer climbs quickly, even without playing... Try to stay between 50°C and 60°C. 55°C being ideal. Again, this is an average. Laptops that are a little old see their temperature systematically increase.

Same thing in game. You can allow yourself temperatures slightly higher than those of a desktop computer, but without doing too much. Between 75°C and 95°C is best. Aim for 85°C to be pretty sure not to take any risks.

## Other temperatures to consider

There is one last important thing to know about this question. To optimize the temperatures of the computer, it is not necessary to be limited to the only temperature of the graphics card… Other temperatures are to be kept in mind. This is obviously the case of the processor.

But you probably already know that… What we often forget, on the other hand, is the temperature of other components present on the motherboard, in particular memory modules and VRMs. A memory module is a board on which the RAM is soldered.

The VRMs, or “Voltage Regulator Modules” are the power stage of the processor. They are there to transform the 12V voltage provided by the power supply into a smaller voltage.

VRM modules consist of a controller, MOSFETs, drivers, coils ( coil or choke ), capacitors (capacitor ) and in some cases doublers. On all these components, overheating is possible.

The temperature of the memory modules and the VRMs can especially have an influence on the temperature of the processor and the GPU.

If you have tried everything to lower the temperature of your GPU but nothing has worked so far, then check the temperature of the memory modules and VRM components.

To make your life easier, be aware that control software such as HWMonitor, which we were talking about above, will tell you all these temperatures, even specifying the temperature you should never exceed depending on the component!

## How to lower GPU temperature?

Sometimes, even when lowering the graphics qualities of games and without overclocking, the graphics card remains overheated, sometimes reaching critical temperatures in just a few minutes.

If this is your case, it's a safe bet that your graphics card environment is not optimized. Remember, there is always context to consider.

To limit temperature rises, there are a few rules to follow at all costs. Otherwise there will always be a risk of overheating.

Start by cleaning your tower or laptop. The main cause of computer heat is dust.

Do not hesitate to invest in a dust bomb provided for this purpose. It costs nothing and can save a lot of hassle.

On older graphics cards, changing the thermal paste can also work wonders. Also change cooler...

But there are other solutions, as simple as updating drivers or stopping overclocking, but also more complex, such as installing water cooling to lower the temperature of the GPU!

To learn more, I invite you to read my complete tutorial on the subject. I have listed 7 tips to help you lower the temperature of your GPU and thus avoid overheating.

## Temperature, an endless question!

If you are like me passionate about hardware, you know how addicted you can become to controls and spend your time checking the slightest variation in temperature of the CPU or GPU… You can quickly become obsessed with the question! Especially since sometimes the reactions of the components can be unpredictable, and some overheating will remain forever incomprehensible.

Better to keep a few truths in mind, to know where you want to go without falling into obsession. As I researched, I came across a few:

* In most cases, the best thing to do is to follow the manufacturer's advice. When he has taken the trouble to indicate the ideal temperatures to respect, it is better to trust him in 99% of cases.
* You can afford a little overheating from time to time, but it is better never to exceed 100°C. 110°, will always be a maximum theoretical limit not to be crossed.
* A laptop will always be a little warmer than a desktop, no matter what. A difference of about ten degrees difference between the two is quite normal.
* There are solutions to lower the temperature of the computer, and especially the GPU. The most effective is to maintain your computer by dusting it regularly, and to buy a good quality cooler.
* As computers age, they find it increasingly difficult to maintain low temperatures.
