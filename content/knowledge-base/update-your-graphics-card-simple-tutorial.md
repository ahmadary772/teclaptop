  - question: Can you use a graphics card without drivers?
    answer: It is possible to use a graphics card without an associated driver.
      However, you will encounter serious performance issues. Your computer will
      still be usable, but you won't be able to use your GPU to its full
      potential. Unable to launch 3D applications and therefore also games.
  - question: Why do you need up-to-date graphics card drivers?
    answer: Graphics card drivers have a big impact on everything related to your
      hardware. For example, having up-to-date drivers helps to fix bugs, which
      can cause instability and crashes. They can also optimize games, and thus
      have better performance. It's not uncommon to gain 10% more fps just with
      up-to-date drivers.
  - question: Are driver update software useful?
    answer: I do not advise you to use this software today. Concretely, the drivers
      that you will have to update frequently are those of your graphics card.
      Other drivers may be updated from time to time. I showed you how to update
      your graphics drivers automatically. Installing additional programs on
      your machine will only increase the amount of programs running in the
      background without any real use.

If you want to know how to update your graphics card drivers, I'll show you the best ways to get up-to-date graphics card drivers.

Method 1: Using Device Manager

The first method is to go through the Windows Device Manager to update the graphics card drivers.

Indeed Windows is able to detect and install the right drivers for a good part of the peripherals that you can put on your PC.

To do this, simply type in the search bar "Device Managers"

Select the first option, normally it should offer you this:

You will come to a panel that looks like this:

Click on the "graphics cards" tab and select the graphics card you want to update. On most PCs, you should only see one.

Now all you have to do is right-click and select "update driver".

And here you have updated your graphics card!

## Method 2: Via the manufacturer's website

The method using the device manager works fine.

However, it often happens that the drivers installed by Windows itself are not the very latest drivers published by the manufacturers.

For example, when releasing major games, Nvidia releases "Game Ready" drivers that are optimized to run the game in question optimally.

So you have to look for them on the manufacturer's website.

First of all you need to know what graphics card you have.

In Windows 10, all you have to do is go to the task manager.

Press Ctrl + Alt + Del on your keyboard. Select, task manager.

Then click on the performance tab. Then select your GPU.

This will give you the model of your graphics card.
Now go to your manufacturer's website.

It's either: Nvidia, AMD or Intel.

## Nvidia

For Nvidia graphics cards, you have to go to the brand's website: you can simply follow this link.

Now all you have to do is enter the references of your product in the selector.

Once you have entered your product click on search.

You will land on a page that will allow you to download an .exe file.

All you have to do is install it.

## AMD

The procedure for AMD graphics cards is the same as for Nvidia cards. The only difference is that you will have to go to the official AMD website. You can follow this link.

Again you select the model of your graphics card and you click on download.

## Intel

For Intel drivers. The procedure is a little different. You will have to go through a small software, which will detect the exact model of Intel graphics card you have. Here is the link to the software.

You can also directly download the drivers for your graphics card model. The problem is that it's much trickier to know which Intel GPU model you have exactly.

## How to automatically update graphics card drivers?

If you do not want to do this kind of manipulation by hand, the best thing is to use the official software provided by the manufacturers.

For example, Nvidia offers through the Geforce Experience an almost automatic driver update. In any case, you will be notified if ever new drivers are available, and you will have the choice to install them or not.

At AMD, the driver update can be done directly via the Control Center (in the latest versions anyway). Again, it will check for you if new drivers are available and install them.

These are the best methods in my opinion to have your drivers up to date.

## Do a "clean" install of the drivers

If you have problems with your graphics card drivers, there is a very handy little program that allows you to do "clean" installations of graphics drivers.

This utility is called DDU: Display Driver Uninstaller (link to download it). Concretely, it often happens that when uninstalling a graphics driver, all traces of the old driver have not been completely erased. This can lead to bugs, or crashes.

If you ever had a problem with your PC after updating graphics card drivers, then using this software could help you redo a clean installation of your drivers.
