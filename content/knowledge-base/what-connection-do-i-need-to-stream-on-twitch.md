Want to know if your internet connection will be sufficient to stream on Twitch? In this article I will tell you everything you need to know about it.

What connection do I need to stream on Twitch? 3 Mbit/s in upload is the minimum to stream in 720p 30fps on Twitch. But the minimum upload speed will mainly depend on the quality you are aiming for to stream. The higher you aim for resolution and framerate, the more bandwidth you will need and vice versa.

So the quality of your internet connection will determine what quality of stream you can have. In the rest of the article, we will see together how to determine the quality of your stream according to your internet connection.

Table of bitrate required for upload according to the resolution and the frame
The first step is to know what the speed of your internet connection and more precisely your upload speed (or upload).

The goal of the game will then be to have a bitrate **between 70% to 80% of your upstream speed.**

The bitrate is the data rate that will be sent to the Twitch server to then be redistributed live to your listeners. The higher the bitrate, the better the quality will be because you allow more data to be sent for encoding and uploading to the server.

The question now is how to determine this famous bitrate.

The first thing to remember is that bitrate is closely related to your video's resolution and framerate.

**The more you want to have a high resolution and a high framerate the more you will have to have a high bitrate.**

Now you are wondering how to calculate bitrate based on resolution and framerates.

I was able to find a calculator online that seems to have correct bitrate estimates.

However, the results should be taken with a grain of salt. Indeed they do not stick with what Twitch officially recommends for streaming.

That said, the bitrates Twitch recommends seem a little too high to me, and you should be fine with less aggressive bitrates. These bitrates have been obtained by “optimizing the quality without wasting bandwidth”, concretely this means that you can lower the bitrate proposed in the table below.

In any case here is a summary of the table of bitrates according to resolution and framerates:

The upload speeds are estimated taking into account a safety margin, in fact internet connections can fluctuate.

And therefore saturating its bandwidth with the upload risks generating lags, and frame drops (tutorial to avoid this kind of problem). So always leave a safety margin.

All this is relatively theoretical, in practice very few of you need to upload in 1080p 60fps, you need to have a really solid machine to stream at this quality of AAA games.

## Bitrate and Image Quality

I told you in the previous part that you could lower the bitrates offered in the table without too much trouble.

Well, in some scenarios, it is possible to lower the bitrate by around 25% while keeping an image quality that is quite acceptable.

It all depends on what you are going to display on the screen. Generally speaking, any games where the screen is constantly moving with a lot of on-screen movement require more bitrate than more laid-back games with a lot of static shots and little movement.

Therefore, to stream in a good FPS quality you will need a higher bitrate and therefore more bandwidth. Here the values ​​that I have reported in the table are good guides.

For calmer, more relaxed games, you can lower the bitrate by 10 to 25% without having too great an impact on the image quality.

However, there are limits that should not be exceeded by lowering your bitrate. At a given resolution and framerate, enough information (bits) must be sent to the encoding and to the Twitch server. So you cannot have a good image quality in 1080p 60fps with only 3000 kbps, the image will not be beautiful to see.

Then you don't need to change the bitrate every time you start a stream, rather try to find the happy medium. Your internet connection will not move, so put the maximum possible bitrate while leaving a margin.

## Why you should leave a margin between your bitrate and your upload speed

Your bandwidth is limited, especially when uploading. If you overload your upload with your stream, other apps will struggle to work properly.

I am thinking in particular of online games, which need a little bandwidth to play. Also you probably want to have your stream back in your favorite web browser to see if everything is working properly.

In addition, if you don't leave a margin you will have a lot more lag and/or frame drops.
