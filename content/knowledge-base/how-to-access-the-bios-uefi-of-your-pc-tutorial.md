When you start to take a little interest in the operation of a PC and its customization, there are two words that you come across very quickly: BIOS and UEFI.

So you will most certainly have to access the BIOS to perform certain manipulations.

There are 2 methods to access the BIOS or UEFI of your PC:

* By pressing F2, F10 or Del when starting your computer.
* By clicking on the “Restart” button in Windows while holding down the SHIFT key on your keyboard. Then click "Troubleshoot" > "Advanced Options" > "Change UEFI Firmware Settings" > "Restart".

In the rest of the article I will show you step by step how to access the BIOS or UEFI of your PC.

## Accessing the BIOS: the two main methods

To access the BIOS of your computer, there are two main methods. It is now very easy to access it using Windows 10. So we will start there! We will then see how to access the BIOS as soon as the computer starts. This can be useful, especially in the event of a major bug, when you do not have Windows 10, or to start Windows from a new hard drive.

## Access BIOS through Windows 10

So let's start with the easiest method, which is to access the BIOS/UEFI from Windows 10. To achieve this, it's simple:

* Click on the “Restart” button while holding down the SHIFT key (above CTRL) on your keyboard.
* A blue menu then appears. Select the “Troubleshoot” option.

* Click on “Advanced options”.
* Click "Change UEFI firmware settings".
* Click "Restart".

  Otherwise to access this same blue menu you can:
* Click on the Windows logo located at the bottom left of your screen.
* Enter the settings by clicking on the small nut.
* Click on “Update & Security”.

* Click "Recovery" in the list on the left.

* Click on the “Restart now” button, which is located at the bottom, under the heading “Advanced startup”.

  ## Access the BIOS when starting the computer
* It can be useful, and sometimes even necessary, to access the BIOS without going through Windows. This is particularly the case when Windows no longer wants to start following a blue screen, or when you have to install a new Operating System on a new PC. To access the BIOS when starting your computer:
* Start the computer and be on your guard. Here, you have to be quick to act before Windows or another operating system has time to start!
  As soon as it boots, try to enter the BIOS by repeatedly pressing a certain key, usually F2, F10 or Del. Sometimes the key to press is indicated for a short time. A “Press Del to enter BIOS” type message then appears. Otherwise, do not hesitate to try several keys in a row by tapping on them continuously for several restarts.
  You are now in the BIOS! Head into the menu, usually using your computer's keyboard.

NB: If you cannot find the key to access the BIOS on your computer, be aware that there are many sites that list the keys to press according to the brand of computer or motherboard. You will sometimes also find this information in the manual of your computer or your motherboard.

## Access BIOS: the case of laptops

Many users wonder how to access BIOS via a laptop. It is true that on this type of computer, the start -up sequences may seem more locked than on a desktop PC. However, accessing BIOS is generally not more complicated on a laptop.

If your laptop runs under Windows, you can access BIOS/UEFI using the method indicated above.

If you want to access BIOS as soon as you start the computer, you can also follow the method indicated above. Small problem here, the sequencing of laptops does not always indicate on which key it is necessary to press in order to access the BIOS/UEFI. So be aware that in many cases, the F2 key allows you to access the BIOS via a laptop. The F10 and F12 keys are also used, especially on compuq and HP brand computers.

## What is the BIOS for?

Now that you know how to access the BIOS, a whole world is open to you! But why do it, you might ask me? Let's take a look!

BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System. To put it simply, we can say that the BIOS is the first program that launches when you turn on your computer. It launches even before Windows starts! It is also the BIOS that tells your computer to launch Windows during startup. UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. This is a more modern version of the BIOS. Its main advantage is to be easier to use.

The BIOS/UEFI is primarily used to initialize essential components and peripherals, and to run the priority application (Windows) via a defined device (usually the computer's main hard drive). This boot sequence is called the “Boot“. By accessing the Boot section of your BIOS, you can decide the order of devices to activate, and thus choose the operating system to launch first. We talk about dual boot when two operating systems are available on a single computer (usually Windows + a Linux-type system like Ubuntu for example).

Of course, the BIOS has other uses. There are more and more often overclocking utilities that allow you to modify the base frequency of the processor and RAM memories.

It also allows you to make some basic display settings, activate, deactivate or even modify parameters for the use of essential components such as RAM, USB ports, DVD player, hard disk or processor. You can also modify certain security parameters and add a password at startup, for example.

Finally you must have access to the bios if you want to update it. Updating your BIOS is a way to solve crashes and bugs (detailed guide to help you solve this kind of problem).
