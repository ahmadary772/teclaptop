If you want to build a PC config to play, choosing the right amount of RAM is an important step. Indeed, if you have too little RAM, your gaming experience may be compromised: lags, stuttering, decreases in fps, etc. Conversely, if you have too much RAM, you will simply have wasted your money on RAM that does not provide more performance in the game.

How much RAM to choose to play in 2022? How much RAM do we really need to play in good conditions?

If you want to play most recent games, 16GB is the ideal amount of RAM. That's enough to play any modern AAA game under good conditions. 8 GB is the minimum amount to play, but for more fluidity, opt for a 16 GB kit instead.

That said, depending on your needs and the use of your computer, 16 GB may not be enough. In the rest of the article I will explain exactly how much RAM is ideal depending on the games you want to run.

| RAM Capacity | Usage                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 4﻿ GB        | O﻿ffice                                                      |
| 8 GB         | Entry Level Gaming                                           |
| 16 GB        | Gaming Versatile and Multitasking                            |
| 32 GB        | Demanding gaming, intensive multitasking, light professional |
| 64 GB +      | Professional heavy                                           |



## 8 GB: For entry-level PCs

As I said before, 8 GB is really the minimum to play in 2022. Indeed when we look at the minimum config indicated for AAA games released in recent years, 8 GB of DDR4 is the amount of RAM minimum to run games.

However, playing with so little RAM can cause your PC to run out of RAM under certain conditions. If you do a little multitasking, with 8 GB you risk running out of RAM. Indeed with RAM-hungry programs like Google Chrome, you will quickly run out of RAM to play.

Finally, I'd say you're fine with 8GB, but I recommend increasing your capacity to 16GB fairly quickly whenever you can.

## 16 GB of RAM: the ideal amount for the vast majority

When analyzing the recommended configs for AAA games released in recent years, 16GB is the quantity that is most cited for the configs recommended by the developers.

Concretely, with 16GB of RAM you can play any game, in good conditions, without worrying.

Depending on the game, you may even have a small performance boost compared to a configuration with only 8 GB of RAM (for example: 10% more on GTA V).

Also, you don't have to worry about background programs. For example, if you have your internet browser open (Chrome) with a lot of tabs open, this will have no impact on your in-game fps.

## 32 GB: for high-end configs and super users

For some uses 16GB of RAM is not a sufficient amount of RAM. Flight simulator 2020, for example, recommends 32 GB of RAM in its Ultra config. Being myself a Flight Simulator player, I can assure you that this game can indeed use up to 20 Gb of memory.

If you want to stream, for example, having a 32GB config is a good idea and will ensure constant fluidity.

This is the amount of RAM I chose for my personal config, and I've never had any problems related to a lack of RAM, despite intensive multitasking, streaming and gaming in Ultra 4K.
It is also the amount of RAM used in most benchmarking setups, to be sure that RAM is not a limiting factor when testing CPUs or GPUs.

If you have the means and it does not encroach on the budget of the other components of your PC, I recommend that you opt for 32 GB, to be quiet.

Finally, from what I have seen on the net, it would seem that opting for 32GB of RAM instead of 16GB would make it possible to eliminate unexplained micro-stutters (on large graphics cards such as RTX 3080) and d to have a greater perceived fluidity in game. Certainly, on all the benchmarks that I have seen, there is no difference in performance between 16GB and 32GB of RAM, but the benchmarks do not always reflect the real uses of the pc. Indeed, they are made on clean installations without programs in the background, which is an unrealistic scenario for the vast majority of gamers. In reality, it is quite possible that having 32 GB could improve the gaming experience…

In any case, having 32 GB is useful for people who want to have a high-end config to play Ultra and 4K-intensive games, while multitasking with several screens simultaneously, when they play. Finally, if you want to get serious about streaming then 32 GB of RAM will not be too much.

## 64 GB and more: for professional use

While it is debatable that 32GB of RAM is overkill for gaming, it is certain and certain that currently 64GB of RAM is far too much for a gaming machine only.

It will be aimed more at professional uses: video editing, photos, 3D rendering, AI.

If, for example, you want to run virtual machines on a computer, with 64 GB of RAM you have enough to do a few virtual machines with 16 GB of dedicated RAM, not bad, isn't it?

Then we could say that 64 GB would allow to be future proof. But honestly, you might be waiting a long time for the developers to ask for 64GB to play. And by then, your kit (and your entire PC) will probably already be quite obsolete.

## Other parameters to consider when choosing RAM

Although the amount of RAM is the most important parameter in choosing a RAM, there are other factors to consider.

For example, avoid taking single-channel RAM kits, i.e. with a single bar. Opt instead for kits with several bars, 2 or 4 to take advantage of dual-channel. This increases the bandwidth between the CPU, this has a real impact on the performance of your PC in game.

In addition, you will have to pay attention to the frequency of your RAM (in Mhz). Theoretically the faster the RAM the better. AMD Ryzen processors particularly appreciate fast RAM. This is also the case with Intel processors but to a lesser extent.

Finally, we are experiencing a transition period between DDR4 and DDR5. DDR5 kits are relatively expensive today and the performance gain is not significant enough to justify the extra cost. But it's better to opt for a good 16GB DDR4 RAM kit, rather than having 8GB of poor DDR5.

Finally, the RAM kit you choose must be compatible and consistent with the configuration you are doing. First of all, it must be compatible with your motherboard. For example, some motherboards can only accept 2 RAM sticks. This is the case on ITX motherboards for example. In addition, I advise you to take kits that have been tested and validated with your motherboard. Normally if you take well-known brand kits (Corsair, Gskill, Kingston, Crucial etc.) compatibility is almost guaranteed.

## Conclusion: 

## Go for 16 GB, or 32 GB if you can afford it

If you can only remember one thing from this article, it's that you can go for 16GB of RAM without asking yourself too many questions.

For example, this 16GB Crucial RAM kit (Amazon link) will do in most PC configurations you can do, all at an affordable price while being compatible with the vast majority of motherboards on the market.

If you mount a high-end config, do not hesitate to take 32GB to be quiet.

If you're really on a tight budget, 8GB can still do the trick, but you'll have to think about upgrading to 16GB fairly quickly.
