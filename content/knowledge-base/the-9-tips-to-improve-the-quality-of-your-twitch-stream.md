You are streaming on Twitch but you find that the quality of your stream is not great. In this article I will give you 10 tips to improve the image and sound quality of your stream.

And so here are the 9 tips to improve the quality of your Twitch livestreams:



1. **Set the resolution, framerate and bitrate to the highest**
2. **Use an SLR camera for your facecam**
3. **Buy a dedicated mic**
4. **Use your graphics card for encoding**
5. **Opt for a dual PC setup**
6. **Put on lights for your stream**
7. **Add acoustic foam**
8. **Speak closer to your microphone**
9. **Upgrade your PC**

## 1. Set the resolution, framerate and bitrate to the highest

This is the number 1 mistake newbie streamers make the first time they use OBS. It also took me some time to find my feet and understand the relationship between bitrate, resolution and framerate.

Concretely, the bitrate is the amount of data per second, sent to the encoder and then uploaded to the Twitch server.

It should be understood that the more a video is in high resolution and high framerate, the more data it takes to encode it correctly.

As a result, the most common error I see on streams where, as soon as the image moves, we only see large pixelated blocks, is that the bitrate is too low for the resolution and framerate chosen. .

However, the bitrate is limited by your upload speed. It will therefore be necessary to grant this one according to internet connection.

Once you have determined your maximum bitrate, you can work out the resolution and framerate at which you can stream.

This operation must be done manually on OBS, which takes a little time to test. That said, there are other software like XSplit and StreamLabs OBS that can do this automatically.

This is generally what I recommend to beginner streamers, and from the tests I have been able to do, these programs work quite well in determining the optimal settings.

You can then adjust them yourself even if you feel that you still have some margin in terms of your bandwidth.

## 2 .Use an SLR camera for your facecam

Having a good quality facecam can dramatically change the look of your stream for the better.

Most webcams will do a pretty decent job of video quality. But if you really want to take a leap in video quality, nothing beats buying a good DSLR camera for streaming.

The classic Canon EOS will do the trick and you will have image quality worthy of the big streamers.

The setup of reflex cameras for streaming will be a little more delicate. In fact, you will need to capture the video stream using a capture box or an acquisition card. The setup is therefore a little more complicated than a simple webcam, but in general the game is worth the effort.

Otherwise you can always opt for a high-end webcam, the quality will not be at the level of the reflex, but it can still be useful for beginners in streaming.

## 3. Buy a dedicated mic

To improve the quality of your sound, nothing better than a good microphone dedicated to recording your voice. Indeed, although headsets / gaming microphones can be decent in terms of sound quality, buying a dedicated microphone will make a big difference in the quality of your voice.
Micro gaming headsets are mainly made for playing, and communicating with your teammates in game, not to be broadcast on Twitch or Youtube, therefore the quality remains in the fair to very poor range.

There is no need to buy super expensive microphones with amps etc. for good sound quality. A good USB microphone, which has proven itself among Youtubers like the famous Blue Yeti, will be more than enough for your debut and even further in your career.

There are plenty of choices and you have some great options for not too expensive. Remember to buy something to mount your microphone so you don't have to hold it in your hand.

## 4. Use your graphics card for encoding

If your graphics card can encode the video stream for you, do it! Nvidia graphics cards have a hardware video stream encoder called NVENC.

The image quality of NVENC is generally very good (provided you set the right settings, bitrates etc.) and the impact on performance is relatively low (but not zero).

On the contrary, software encoding, which is done by the processor, will impact in-game performance because the processor will be heavily used for encoding the video stream. It is possible to minimize the impact by choosing specific presets (fast and veryfast), but you will lose image quality.

In general, hardware encoding with an Nvidia graphics card is the preferred solution. So check the configuration of your Stream, OBS or StreamLabs software to see what type of encoding is used.

Also check the presets for those using OBS from the NVENC encoder, make sure it's set to "quality".

## 5. Opt for a dual PC setup

Here we enter the kind of configuration made for serious streamers. Those who manage to make a living from it. I'm not a fan of this solution personally. With a high-end configuration, a single PC can do both very well without any problems.

That said, if your goal is to have the maximum image quality possible, then yes a dual PC setup is the ideal solution.

It consists of separating the two tasks of streaming, i.e. generating the images of the game, and encoding the video stream in two separate PCs. So you will have both maximum performance in game, since your gaming PC does only that, and maximum encoding quality since PC streaming does only that too.

The main problem with this kind of configuration is the price, you will have to buy two machines.

That said, if you have a PC lying around you can always convert it back to a streaming PC. An old high-end configuration should be able to encode without too much trouble.

Finally, setting up this kind of setup is not trivial, there are many guides on how to do it, but be aware that you will have to spend some time configuring everything.

Basically you will need to use a capture card to then send the video stream to the streaming PC which will do the encoding work.

## 6. Put on lights for your stream

Whatever the quality of your webcam or reflex camera, a poorly lit room will drastically lower the video quality of your cam face. If you have a well-lit room, natural light can do the trick provided you have good sunlight, which is not always guaranteed.

Investing in lights is therefore a great idea. No need to buy pro gear either, but a few studio lights will help a lot.

I am especially thinking of the Elgato Key light which has become the reference in terms of good quality and not too expensive lighting for streaming on Twitch.

One may be enough but taking two to have uniform lighting would not hurt you.

## 7. Add acoustic foam

We don't often think about it, but adding acoustic foam to your stream setup will significantly improve the sound quality of your microphone.

For those who don't know, sound waves bounce off hard surfaces like walls, creating a resonant effect and therefore lower recording quality.
This is why all recording studios are equipped with it.

There are several techniques to reduce the reverberation of acoustic waves, basically anything that is soft will help absorb the parasitic waves.

So you can put a duvet in front of you or have cushions all over the room.

But the most effective is the addition of acoustic foam on the walls.

There are different qualities of acoustic foam but if you are not a sound professional, a cheap foam on Amazon will do the trick.

## 8. Speak closer to your mic

Surely one of the simplest and most effective tips for improving microphone quality. Speak closer to him! Many Youtubers waste hundreds or even thousands of dollars on high-end microphones, and end up talking 1m or 2m away from it.

If you watch how the pros use their mics you will notice that their mouths sit extremely close to the mic. This allows for the maximum clarity in the voice.

Getting used to speaking so close to your microphone will take some getting used to. But the game is worth the effort, and this simple trick will save you sound quality without having to change your gear.

## 9 .Upgrade your PC

The other error that I often see is not having a PC config adapted to the stream. Streaming requires resources, and a gaming PC with entry-level components will not be enough in most cases to stream in good quality.

If your PC is struggling to run Valorant, CS:GO, and LoL, then there's no need to think about streaming.

I would even say that a mid-range config that is a little dated will also have a lot of trouble, and it won't get better over time.

Games becoming more and more greedy, and the arrival of new rendering technologies (RTX, DLSS, VRS, etc.), make many graphics cards before are really obsolete.

You don't really have a choice for Streamer, you have to invest in a really solid basic machine.

## Conclusion

By applying these 9 tips you can drastically improve the quality of your streams and thus attract more viewers and subs.

But remember that even if you start with modest means, that does not mean that you have no chance of breaking through. The goal of this article is to make your stream watchable. And even with few means it is quite possible to have a decent stream quality.

Apply these 9 tips as you go, some are free others require a little investment, start with the easiest, and end with the hardest.
