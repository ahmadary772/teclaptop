## Introduction

\
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.
