If you want to know how to see the consumption of your graphics card in real time, and especially how to display it in OSD when you play, in this article I will give you two methods to do so.

## Method 1: With GPU-Z

The first method is the easiest and most accessible since you just need to install the GPU-Z software.

[Visit the TechPowerUp website](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/) to download the software.
Go through all the installation steps (as for any program) and launch the software.

You will come across this interface, which allows you to have all the possible and unimaginable details on your graphics card.

But it is especially the “Sensors” tab that will interest us.

It is in this panel that you will find the graphics card consumption in real time.

You will thus have the power consumption of the entire card, but also other details such as what consumes only the graphics chip, the memory modules, the input voltage, the power drawn by each power connector, etc.

And There you go ! You can monitor the power consumption of your graphics card in real time.

The problem is that if you want to see it in game, you will have to do ALT-TAB, which is not necessarily the most practical.

So I propose another method for those who want to have the consumption of their GPU live and on screen overlay.

## Method 2: MSI Afterburner and HWinfo64

### 1)Download and install MSI Afterburner

The first step is to download and install MSI Afterburner. It is a utility to "tuner" its graphics card.
So you can overclock it, underclock it or even undervolt it.

But it comes with another extremely interesting software, and essential for this tutorial, which is RIVA TURNER Statistics Server.

When you install MSI Afterburner, also install this software.

It comes with Afterburner but you have to make sure that during the installation steps you have not forgotten it.

Normally if all goes well, you will have in the list of your programs, Riva Turner Statistics Server and MSI Afterburner.

That said, MSI Afterburner alone does not allow us to have the consumption of the graphics card in real time.

You need to install another software: HWiNFO64.

### 2)Download and install HWiNFO64



The other essential software is HWiNFO64.

This software is a bit like HWMonitor, but much more advanced. It is available in a free version (which is the one that interests us) and allows you to have a detailed report on your PC: CPU temperature, GPU, Memory, SSD etc.

Go to the official website of HWiNFO64

Once you have it installed, we can start setting it all up!

### 3)Launch MSI Afterburner and HWinfO64

To have the display of the values you want to monitor superimposed, both software must be active.

Launch Afterburner:

Go to the Afterburner options:

Then go to the control tab in the part where you can choose the selected graphics:



* GPU temperature
* GPU usage

  And check the box "Show on screen overlay" for both.

  In this way you will have the temperature and the use of your GPU in game.

  Then launch the HWinfo64 software, you can check the “sensor only” box and click on “Run”.

You will come across a panel like this:

Click on the gear, which allows you to access the settings

Go to the “OSD(RTSS)” tab

Now look in the list for "GPU Power". There are plenty of options, so don't panic if you can't find it the first time.

Once you have found it, check the box “Show value in OSD”.

And There you go ! You will have the consumption of your GPU in real time directly on your screen. In addition you will see the temperature and GPU usage.
