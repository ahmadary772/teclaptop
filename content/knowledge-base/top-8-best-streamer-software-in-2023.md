Wondering what is THE best software to launch livestreams? Between OBS, Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, LightStream etc. you still don't know which one to choose? In this article I will present most of the streaming software out there, their strengths and weaknesses to see which one is best for you.

## 1. OBS: the best known and the most used

In summary:

Strong points:

* Top performance
* Personalization possibilities

Weak points:

* Austere Interfaces
* Apprenticeship reques



Impossible not to mention the legendary Open Broadcaster Software more commonly known as OBS. It is THE streaming software used by the vast majority of the community.

The reasons why it is so used are quite simple to understand: OBS is powerful and above all free.

No subscription to access additional features, no paywall, OBS is completely free.

In addition, it offers outstanding performance, it is extremely light to run, and the encoding quality is superb.

The options at your disposal are legion, and with a little experience you can get the most out of OBS in order to have an irreproachable Stream quality.

So OBS is the perfect software? Not really…

Indeed OBS is powerful, but you have to do everything yourself. Stream configuration, overlays, scenes, etc. Everything has to be done by hand.

For a novice there are therefore a lot of elements to assimilate. To launch a correct stream on OBS, you will need to set up a lot of things. And if you want your stream to look pro, then you need even more work.

It's not insurmountable. But it's a brake for the "not good at computers", and those who just want to stream and without taking the lead.

## 2. StreamLabs OBS: an OBS revisited

In summary:

Strong points:

* Performance similar to OBS
* The self-configuration that allows you to launch your first stream by
  a few minutes

Weak points:

* Paywalls
* More greedy than OBS

If you are familiar with OBS, then surely you have heard of the StreamLabs OBS version. As the name suggests it is basically a modified version of OBS. OBS being an Open Source software anyone can, if he wishes, change aspects of the software at his sauces. That's exactly what the creators of StreamLabs OBS do.

The goal was to take the strengths of OBS, and fill in the gaps, the bet is largely successful in my opinion.

The Streamlabs OBS interface is much more user-friendly, and setting up your first stream is a breeze.

The possibility of using themes to have already pre-designed Overlays and scenes is a huge plus, compared to classic OBS.

Streamlabs also adds a lot of extra features that make your life easier.

The transition to OBS and StreamLabs OBS is also a breeze, you can import the profiles you had already created on OBS.

So is StreamLabs OBS perfect? No more…

The creators of Streamlabs OBS offers a Prime membership to get access to features on top of Streamlabs. For example, some overlay themes are paid for and with a Prime subscription you will have access to these and many other advantages.

Finally, be aware that StreamLabs is a little more resource intensive than OBS. The video quality is pretty much the same, but StreamLabs OBS because of the extra features will be more cumbersome to run.

Honestly with a Stream PC the impact on in-game performance is nil, but on more modest machines this can be a criterion of choice.

## 3. XSplit Gamecaster: An Alternative to OBS



In summary:

Strong points:

* Good performance
* Simple user interface

Weak points:

* More greedy than OBS
* Bugs and lack of stability

XSplit is also one of the best known software for streaming on Twitch. It is not a branch of OBS, but rather a competing software.
I have already done an analysis of XSplit Gamecaster vs OBS. XSplit Gamecaster is in the same philosophy as StreamLabs OBS, it aims to create an easy-to-use streamer software, in order to get rid of the technical aspect of OBS.

Thus XSplit also has an automatic configuration that will find the right encoding parameters depending on your internet connection and your PC.

Having tested it myself, the automatic configuration is impressive, and the settings chosen were quite adequate.

We also find the same kind of customization as on StreamLabs OBS, with the possibility of importing themes from the interface directly in order to dress up your stream.

XSplit's main problem is its greediness. It is much heavier to run than OBS in both memory and CPU usage.
Again if you have a recent high-end machine nothing to worry about.

Finally, I found that XSplit was not super stable during my tests. For example, the automatic detection of the game to be captured worked quite well at first, but after a few sessions it was impossible to get it to work.

On OBS I sometimes have this black screen problem because of a source problem, but most often it was due to mishandling. But there, XSplit simply refused to capture my Call of Duty Warzone gameplay and I couldn't solve the problem.

## 4. XSplit Broadcaster : Le XSplit des pros

In summary:

Strong points:

* Good performance
* Lots of features

Weak points:

* resource hungry
* May be difficult to learn for novices

If you know XSplit Gamecaster you should also know that there is a more complete version XSplit Broadcaster.

The difference between the two is that Broadcaster is aimed more at the professional and not just for livestreaming games on Twitch.

If you want to do a live broadcast with multiple camera angles, technical control etc. XSplit Broadcaster is made for.

That doesn't mean you can't use it to stream on Twitch, far from it.

But it is aimed more at professionals and the setup of the stream will therefore be a little more advanced and more complicated to set up.

If you are a veteran streamer, with multiple camera angles to handle multiple sources for video and audio, then yes XSplit Broadcaster might be a better solution than Gamecaster which is easy to use but limited in functionality.

## 5. vMix

In summary:

Strong points:

* Lots of features
* Perfect for professional broadcasts

Weak points:

* Difficult to learn for novices
* Very limited in its free version

Vmix is ​​a video broadcasting and recording software like XSplit Broadcaster. Again, it is more geared towards audiovisual professionals and not just streaming on Twitch. We can thus with Vmix record and stream at the same time, which to my knowledge is not possible with OBS.

Vmix is ​​therefore mainly used in the professional world, if you are organizing an eSport event, a replay of a live concert, etc.

You will therefore have understood that although it can be used as streaming software it is far from ideal, and from what I have seen it does not look easy to master.

All the same if you plan to broadcast a big event live on Youtube, Twitch etc, then Vmix may be a solution that will suit you.

The main flaw is that it is not free.

There is a free version but you cannot go beyond 768 x 576 in output resolution which is extremely low.

I don't want to be too negative, but I think this software is not for the vast majority of you.

## 6. Wirecast: The software for the pros

In summary:

Strong points:

* Lots of features
* Perfect for professional broadcasts
* Easy to handle

Weak points:

* extremely expensive

In the same vein as Vmix and XSplit Broadcaster, Wirecast is a professional video broadcasting and recording software.

Their marketing is mainly geared towards the pros, but you can totally use it to do your Livestreams.

The user interface is excellent and the possibilities offered by the software are really numerous.

For example you can add text on stream, directly from the software, you can manage transitions between scenes, add graphics, images and overlays to your sources etc.

If you manage to master the software, you will be able to achieve professional quality during your streams which is pretty cool.

Wirecast is super well thought out and it is software that is appreciated by the pros.

The main negative point is its price: $599 for the cheapest version… For professionals it is not much, but for beginners in streaming it is not a good investment.

Moreover, if you only livestream video games on Twitch, Wirecast is simply “overkill” for this kind of use.

And you will have to design your own overlays for them integrated into the software. Which is not for everyone.

## 7. Twitch Studio (Beta)

In summary:

Strong points:

* Easy to handle
* Self-configuration

Weak points:

* Still in beta
* Limited in its functionality

Twitch launched its own streaming software in 2019, called Twitch Studio. It is currently in Beta, which means that there are probably a lot of bugs and that it will evolve when it is released.

Like a lot of software dedicated to Stream on Twitch, it is mainly made to get you started as quickly as possible.
You therefore have a configuration screen the first time you launch the software to adjust the basic stuff: your camera, your microphone, the scenes, and the stream quality which will be, as on XSplit and StreamLabs OBS, calculated according to your components and your internet connection. You can of course adjust these settings yourself if you wish.

You have a newsfeed of your stream directly integrated into the software to follow your donations, subscriptions etc.

In itself Twitch Studio does not bring anything special compared to XSplit Gamecaster or StreamLabs, but if you do not like these two software for one reason or another then you can try your luck with Twitch Studio.

## 8. Lightstream 

In summary:

Strong points:

* Very easy to handle
* No software installation

Weak points:

* Very limited features

Lightstream is a bit apart in the category. Indeed it is not a software but a web application for streaming! This means that you don't have to install anything on your computer. Everything is done through an internet browser.

I was quite amazed to see that we could stream from a web application.

However, there are some limitations due to the fact that it is a web application. Indeed, there is no possibility of adding personalized overlays to your stream.

Finally, you can't stream at more than 720p60fps even using their paid offer, which is definitely a big obstacle in my opinion.

Lightstream is therefore an original alternative but still suffers from a lot of limitations.

## Conclusion: Which to Choose?

If you want to stream games on Twitch without the hassle:

**StreamLabs OBS or XSplit Gamecaster are the best choices in my opinion.** Twitch Studio is still in beta and I find that it still lacks features to make it interesting. XSplit and StreamLabs OBS are already well established and proven.

You want to stream on Twitch and you are computer savvy:

OBS is the best option in my opinion. It is light and the possibilities offered are numerous provided you know how to get used to it. Plus, it's the most well-known of all the streaming software featured in this list, so you have a great community available if you need help.

## Do you want to make professional quality livestreams?

**Then XSplit Broadcaster and Vmix are excellent options.** This is for those who have a complex setup, with multiple audio and video sources to manage. In my opinion, these software are excellent for this kind of situation, without going into ultra complex and expensive solutions.

Do you want to organize events and broadcast them live?

In my opinion, it is the perfect job for Wirecast with its very user-friendly interface and also the extremely advanced management possibilities.
