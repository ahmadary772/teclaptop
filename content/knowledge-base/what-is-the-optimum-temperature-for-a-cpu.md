In terms of temperatures on the computer, there are two main components to check: the graphics card and the processor. We are especially used to checking the temperatures when we want to optimize the yields on a greedy game

Regular monitoring of the CPU temperature is recommended especially for graphic designers, video editors and 3D modelers.

And so what is the optimum temperature for a CPU? In reality, there is no optimum temperature, the colder your CPU the better. That said, in intensive use it is recommended not to exceed 85°C. At rest, any temperature below 50°C is acceptable.

## CPU temperature: some important things to know

It would be pointless, even counterproductive, to simply give you “optimal” temperatures for the CPU to maintain. As you will see, there are certain things you need to know in order to carry out effective checks, and above all to be able to act effectively in the event of overheating.

## How to Check CPU Temperature

To optimize the temperature of the various elements of your computer, and in particular the processor, you must first of all know how to control it correctly! So let's start there!

First of all, you should know that the concept of CPU temperature is not as obvious as one might think at first glance. Indeed, a CPU is made up of different components. And each of these components does not have the same temperature…

On most CPUs, sensors have been placed in the cores of the processor as well as on its metal surface, precisely designed to diffuse heat efficiently. Of course, the temperature of the processor cores is always significantly higher than the temperature measured on the metal surface.

Depending on the manufacturer and CPU model, the available temperatures will therefore not be the same. Depending on the case, you may find yourself faced with a list of core temperatures and structure temperature, or else a general average. Keep this in mind and, if necessary, consult the manufacturer's instructions to find out how to read the temperatures read.

In any case, to know the temperatures of the CPU, there are two main solutions.

If you want to control only your CPU temperature, the best thing to do is to use the Core Temp software . This software is regularly updated, and it is optimized to control the temperature of the processors precisely, in real time. This is the best when you want to control only the CPU in detail.
But to make your life easier, know that there is software such as HWMonitor , which allows you to control the temperature of the various components of the PC, but also the speed of the fans, on a single screen.

With software of this style, it is possible to take a CPU temperature reading much more easily. Because let's be clear, ordinary mortals do not have much use for software as precise and limited as Core Temp.

Better, in my opinion, to use a single software like HWMonitor to know all the temperatures and the state of the fans, even if it means losing precision slightly.

With multitasking software, you can take a global look at the temperatures and thus make a diagnosis much more easily in the event of a problem.

## Check CPU temperature in BIOS

Finally, note that it is possible to control the temperature of the processor directly through the BIOS. Of course, the usefulness of this approach is severely limited. Going through the BIOS, you will not be able to control the impact of different software on the processor temperature.

But in case of a big problem, especially if you can no longer launch Windows, it can be useful to control the temperature of the processor as soon as the computer starts. To check CPU temperature in BIOS:

* Go to the BIOS by pressing the key provided at startup. Generally, the key to press is indicated when the logos appear. But if not, try pressing F2, F12, Esc or Del. repetitively. These are the most common keys.
* Then it all depends on your BIOS. Use the keys on your keyboard to move through the BIOS menu and find the temperature check utility.

## Keep a global vision of things

To properly control the temperature of the different elements of your PC, you must always keep an overall view of its use. If this is true for the graphics card, it is even more so for the processor!

As with the GPU, the CPU temperature varies depending on whether you are on a laptop or a desktop PC, but also depending on the duration of use, the situation, and the temperature of the other components of the computer. . Of course, the answers and the solutions to bring in the event of too much heat can vary. Finally, be aware that the ideal temperatures to aim for also vary depending on the brand of processor.

In this article, I will try to give you an optimal temperature for the CPU, but even more than for the temperature of the graphics card, keep in mind that this is a range. Unfortunately, no perfect number, which would be valid for all processors in all situations, exists.

Depending on whether you are editing a video, playing a game, whether this game is greedy or not, or whether you are simply watching a video on Youtube, the "ideal" temperature, will of course not be the same at all!

## The CPU temperature not to be exceeded

Last essential point to address before concretely dealing with the question that interests us: the CPU temperature that should never be exceeded. It is vital to never exceed the maximum recommended temperatures.

In the short term, an overheating processor can slow down and even crash your system. Indeed, past a certain threshold, the computer stops suddenly to avoid being damaged. But above all, if the overheating is repeated, the various elements of your computer could be irreparably damaged.

To avoid this, it is necessary to know the threshold not to be exceeded. This threshold may vary somewhat, but as a general rule, it is estimated that a CPU should not exceed 80°C.

**From 85°C, it is really time to slow down.**

### In any case, no CPU should exceed 100°C.

From 100°C, the CPU will slow down its operating frequency to avoid damage. If it fails, the system will simply shut down abruptly.

## The optimal temperature for a processor on a desktop computer


Now that we have a little clearer ideas, we can try to consider an ideal CPU temperature for a desktop computer. But let's repeat it once again, the temperatures of a CPU are so variable depending on the circumstances and the uses that we can only provide you with relatively wide ranges here. Also remember that the temperatures of the different cores and the structure can vary. In particular, anomalies can cause the temperature of a single core to rise above the recommended thresholds. Of course, we cannot take all situations into account... We will therefore only mention the average temperatures for the entire CPU.

To do well, the wisest reflex is certainly to consult the manual of the processor. The designers of your CPU have carefully studied the questions. They carried out a battery of tests on this processor to study the resistance and performance of the components in the most varied circumstances. Enjoy!

That being said, it is better to be prepared for all eventualities! To guide you in any situation, here are some numbers to keep in mind:

First, it is obvious that depending on whether you are in game, using greedy software or at rest, the temperatures to aim for will not be the same at all…

At rest, a desktop CPU should have a temperature between 40°C and 60°C.

**As a general rule, the temperature to aim for is therefore around 50°C**. But this is obviously an average, and as you can see the range is wide.

In game, or when using particularly greedy software, the temperature will inevitably increase. AVX instructions, for example, which are used in scientific simulations, financial analyses, 3D modeling, image processing and data compression, among other things, quickly raise the thermometer. But as a general rule, the ideal temperatures for heavy work are between 60°C and 80°C.



### The target temperature is therefore around 70° for more intensive use.

## The optimal temperature for a processor on a laptop

Now let’s move on to the ideal temperatures to aim for laptop processors. The important thing to know here is that expected temperatures are always a bit higher on laptops than on desktops. Ventilation and heat removal systems are often less efficient, and CPU manufacturers always act accordingly.

As with a desktop computer's CPU, the first thing you should do is consult your laptop's manual, or consult its processor's documentation. In this way you will be informed much more precisely, and without having to fear an error of assessment.

But here are the general temperature ranges to know. At idle, the temperatures expected for a laptop CPU will be slightly higher than the temperatures expected on a desktop PC. On older laptops, the expected temperatures will be even higher… But as a general rule, it is best to aim for a temperature between 50°C and 70°C when idle. There is therefore no risk of being wrong by aiming for temperatures around 60°C at start-up.

Same thing for intensive use, in game or with AVX instructions. The ideal temperature is often between 65°C and 85°C. 75°C can therefore be seen as an ideal temperature. But again, take these numbers with a grain of salt and refer first and foremost to the manufacturer's manual(s) to be sure not to make any mistakes.

## How to lower CPU temperature

If you notice that your CPU temperatures regularly exceed 80°C on your desktop PC or 90°C on your laptop, it is better to try to remedy it quickly. Without it, your components could be damaged.

If you reach such temperatures without having the feeling of forcing too much (by overclocking or playing games that are a little too greedy for your config for example), and if your PC is not very old, then the your computer's temperature management is probably not optimized. However, to limit temperature rises, there are a few essential rules to follow. Fortunately, they are not very complicated!

Probably the most important thing is to clean your tower or laptop. The main cause of computer heat is often dust! Regularly remove the dust that has accumulated using a dusting can or a dry cloth.

Changing the thermal paste and buying a better cooler can also lower the CPU temperature significantly… I just did a full article where I give the best coolers for each CPU on the market.

There are many other solutions to reduce CPU heat. No need to list them all here, I have already written a complete tutorial on this subject! If you want to know more, do not hesitate to consult my article. I have listed 7 tricks to help you lower your CPU temperature and prevent overheating.

## CPU temperatures: my 4 tips to remember


When you start to take an interest in hardware issues and the temperatures of its components, you can quickly become addicted. We are surprised to check the temperature variations in all situations! In doing so, we go from discovery to discovery, and we learn more every day on a subject so vast that a dedicated blog would not be enough.

But in order to be able to react in the best possible way in all situations, knowing a few essential points is generally enough to avoid mistakes.

Regarding the CPU temperature, **here are my 4 main tips:**

* You will never make a mistake by following the manufacturer's advice.
  Research the ideal temperatures to reach and those not to exceed on your various components.
* For all other PCs, it is better not to exceed the 85°C mark for the CPU.
* To lower the temperature, the most effective will always be to maintain your computer by dusting it regularly, and to buy a good quality cooler.
* The older a computer is, the harder it will be to keep temperatures low. This development is completely normal.
