If you want to buy a new PC, or if you are simply curious to know what is in a computer, in this article I will give you a list of the components that are found in a PC. modern (whether fixed or portable).

Here is the list of components that you will find in a PC:

* The motherboard
* The processor (or CPU)
* Random access memory (or RAM)
* The graphics card (or GPU)
* Storage (HDD or SSD)
* The power supply
* The box
* The recooling

This list will help you better understand what each component does. I have also grouped the essential components, and the optional components.

Required components in a PC
So let's start with the components that you absolutely must have in your machine. Without one of these components your PC is simply unusable.

## 1.Motherboard

![ Motherboard](/uploads/download.jpg)



The motherboard is the component on which all the other components of the computer will be attached. This is what will make the connection between the CPU, RAM, graphics card and storage.

The choice of a motherboard depends mainly on the type of processor you want to have with your PC.

Currently the two brands of processors you need to know about are AMD and Intel. Each of these brands require different types of motherboards because AMD processors are not compatible with Intel motherboards and vice versa.

You will therefore choose your "platform" on which your components will be based. In addition, there are different generations of motherboards depending on the generation of compatible processors.

The latest generations of AMD motherboards are: motherboards with a X570, B550, A520 Chipset.

The latest generations of Intel motherboards are: Z490, Z590, B460, B560.

These code names have special meanings and indicate the line of motherboard chosen.

## 2. Processor

![Processor](/uploads/processor.jpg)

The processor (or CPU) is the brain of the computer. It is he who will execute all the general instructions necessary for the operation of the computer.

The CPU is directly connected to the motherboard through the socket. This is what will allow it to communicate with the other components of the computer.

You must therefore ensure the compatibility of your processor with the motherboard you have chosen.

The power of the CPU will therefore have a direct impact on the overall performance of your machine.

There are different parameters to take into account for power: the age of the architecture (the more recent it is, the more efficient the processor in theory), the number of cores/threads, the operating frequency, the cache memory, etc. .

You have the choice between 2 CPU brands Intel and AMD. Each of these brands offers different ranges of processors. If you want to know how to have a classification of processors according to their power in Gaming, we have just written an article which classifies processors.

To summarize, the latest generations of processor at Intel is the 11th: 11900K, 11700K, 10900K, 10700K, etc.

And at AMD the latest generation is the 5000 series: 5950X, 5900X, 5800X etc.

## 3. RAM

![ RAM](/uploads/corsair-dominator-platinum-ddr5-32-go.jpg)

Random Access Memory, (RAM) is your computer's short-term memory. This is where programs load the data they will need to run.

When the computer shuts down, everything that was in RAM is erased. This is why PCs need long-term memory: the SSD.

The amount and speed of RAM will have a direct impact on the performance of your machine.

There are several generations of RAM: DDR, DDR2, DDR3, and finally DDR4, the one we currently use.

You will need to choose an amount of RAM for your PC: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB etc.

The more RAM you have, the more tasks your PC will be able to perform simultaneously.

In general for gaming we recommend having between 8GB, 16GB or 32GB of RAM.

DDR4 RAM is the fastest RAM currently. But this one comes in different frequencies: 2133 MHz, 2666 MHz, 3000 MHz etc. The higher the frequency and the faster it is, the higher the performance.

## 4. Graphic card 

![Graphic card]()

The graphics card (or GPU) has the function of managing the display of elements on your screen. That said, the graphics card has other functions which are essential.

For video games, she will do the 3D rendering in real time.

The graphics card and CPU combo is what will dictate the power of your computer for video games.

Today, the main graphics chip manufacturers are Nvidia and AMD.

The latest generations at Nvidia is the RTX 3000 series: RTX 3090, RTX 3080, RTX 3070, RTX 3060

And at AMD it's the RX 6000 series: RX 6900XT, RX 6800XT etc.

Here again we have made a ranking of the most powerful graphics cards to the least powerful ones.

The graphics card connects to the PCI-express port on the motherboard.

That said, processors today sometimes have what is called an integrated graphics card. That is, the graphics chip is inside the processor.

So you can buy a PC that does not have a dedicated graphics card but a graphics card in the processor.

However, the performance of integrated graphics chips is far from modern dedicated graphics cards.

At Intel, the majority of fixed PC processors have a graphics part.

At AMD this is less often the case, but they also exist.

##  5. Storage (SSD/HDD) 

![Storage (SSD/HDD)]()

If the RAM is a short term storage, the SSD/HDD is the long term storage of the PC. Unlike RAM, data is not lost when the computer shuts down.

There are 2 types of data storage:

* Hard drives
* SDDs

Hard drives (or HDDs) are now increasingly obsolete due to the arrival of SSDs.

The main difference between these two types of storage is the speed: 100 Mb/s for HDDs against up to 5000 Mb/s for the latest generation NVMe SSDs.

An SSD is much faster (in terms of data transfer rate, and access speed) than the hard disk.

Today modern PCs work with one or more SSDs for storage.

You can create a machine with only HDDs but the responsiveness of your PC will suffer greatly: slow start-up, programs that take time to load, slow file transfer, etc.

Hard drives are doomed to disappear completely in favor of SSDs.

Finally know that there are two types of SSD, SATA and NVMe if you want to know the difference and especially what type of SSD to buy here is my guide on the subject.

## 6. Power-supply

![ Power-supply]()



Your PC needs to be supplied with electricity to function. The problem is that it is necessary to transform the alternating current from the electrical outlet into current usable by the components of the computer.

It is the role of the power supply to take care of the conversion.

All PCs have a power supply. This varies according to the maximum power it can deliver in Watts.

Your power supply will therefore be chosen according to what your components consume.

## 7. Case

![Case]()

It is possible to have a PC without a case to speak of, but it is not practical to leave the components with the electronic circuit in the open air without something to protect them.

You therefore need a box for your PC.

The choice of case will mainly depend on the size of the components you put in it.

## 8. Cooling

![ Cooling]()

If your graphics card is equipped with dedicated cooling, this is not necessarily the case for the CPU. Depending on the processors, the manufacturer (Intel or AMD) may or may not include a cooler with the processor.

For high-end processors, you are forced to buy a third-party cooling solution.

There are two types of cooling: coolers and watercooling.

In general, water cooling is more efficient than simple coolers but also more expensive.

Finally you must also add fans in the case of your PC to prevent the components from overheating. The case being closed, fans are needed to bring in fresh air and evacuate hot air.

## Optional components

Now that I have listed all the mandatory components in a PC, I will give you a list of optional components.

That is to say that it is up to you to determine whether you will need it or not depending on the use of your machine.

## Blue-Ray/DVD/CD optical drive

The optical drive was a decade ago a must in PCs. Today, with dematerialization, the usefulness of an optical reader has drastically declined.

Thus, modern boxes no longer have an optical drive bay at the front.

You can still add an optical drive to your machine as a USB device that you plug into your computer.

## Soundcard

Today the cards have become completely accessory in modern PCs. Indeed the sound processing is now done by the motherboard directly.

Indeed, the audio processing of motherboards today is very good and therefore for the vast majority of people, a sound card is superfluous.

If you're in the music business, then having a dedicated card for sound processing is probably a good investment.

## Network/wifi card

Again, network / wifi cards are also superfluous because motherboards also often have a wifi antenna, and an integrated network card.

That said, if you bought a motherboard in WiFi and you want to add wifi later, buying a wifi card is justifiable. But it would have been cheaper to buy a motherboard with built-in wifi directly.
