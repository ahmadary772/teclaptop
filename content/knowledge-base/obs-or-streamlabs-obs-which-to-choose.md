You wonder if you should choose between OBS or StreamLabs OBS to stream your gameplay on Twitch, in this article we will see what are the differences between the two and which one you should choose (in my opinion).

OBS or StreamLabs OBS? If you only stream on Twitch, StreamLabs OBS brings a lot of additional features compared to OBS because it is a customized and optimized version of OBS for streaming. Many things that you have to configure by hand in OBS are already pre-configured in StreamLabs OBS (or SLOBS) which therefore makes it good software for beginners.

In the rest of the article I will give you a slightly more detailed comparison of Streamlabs OBS compared to OBS.



## OBS vs StreamLabs OBS: what StreamLabs OBS does more

Everyone knows OBS, it's the free Open-Source software that allows you to record your screen, and do livestream on Youtube and Twitch.

It is the best known software in the field and if you want to start streaming you have probably already heard of it.

Since OBS is Open Source, anyone can, if they wish, take the source code and make changes to it to improve it and add features.
That's exactly what the creators of Streamlabs OBS do.

Thus StreamLabs keeps the performance of OBS but adds many more features to make it more user-friendly.

## A customized and improved interface

One of the main improvements is the user interface which has been revamped a bit to make it more pleasant. The basic interface of OBS is relatively austere, that of StreamLabs OBS is more user-friendly and above all customizable with personalized themes.

StreamLabs OBS adds important information to the interface, in particular the “Live” tab which allows you to see who has subscribed, who has made a donation, etc.

## Auto-optimization of parameters

The first time you start StreamLabs OBS, you will have a configuration screen that will allow you to connect your Twitch account to StreamLabs, import your OBS settings (if you have them) and also do an automatic configuration of your settings. stream. Depending on your PC and your internet connection, StreamLabs OBS will find the optimal settings for your stream to ensure good image quality. Of course, you can later change these settings as you wish.

But I find that the auto-configuration is one of the strengths of the software compared to OBS. And the results it gives are most of the time correct. Some people have been able to drastically improve the quality of their livestream precisely thanks to this auto-configuration.

## Add Overlays

Surely one of the most important features of StreamLabs. You will be able to customize the appearance of your stream by downloading pre-made Overlays from the StreamLabs store.

By doing this, Streamlabs OBS will directly place the elements in the right places, the chat, your webcam, the start and end screens. Everything is already done for you.

If you are a beginner streamer this is probably the best way to start on Twitch.
Otherwise you have to specify everything by hand which can be complicated the first time you start livestreaming on Twitch.

## Create alerts

When you stream you want to see who donates to you, who subscribes, etc.
With StreamLabs OBS triggering alerts is easy to configure. All you have to do is add the right widget and you're good to go.

Of course you have the possibility to customize the alerts, so you can choose which gif/animation will appear in order to customize the stream to your taste.

## Remote Control

Another feature in addition, the Remote Control or remote control in French. It allows you to create a sort of virtual Stream Deck on your phone.

For those who do not know what a Streamdeck is for, I recommend that you go see the article on this subject where I explain in detail what it is for.

Thanks to the Remote Control you can add practical shortcuts on your phone to manage your stream: Start live, change scene, mute your microphone etc.

So you no longer need to tamper with the software to do this kind of action, everything is at your fingertips.

As I said above it is a low-cost alternative to the Streamdeck, and for those who are new to streaming it is ideal.

## What StreamLabs OBS lacks

As you can see StreamLabs is really nice to use when you're new to streaming.

That said, that doesn't mean that StreamLabs is better than OBS at everything.

For example, if you want to record gameplay and upload it to Youtube later, you have a record option.

However compared to OBS it is more limited in option. For example Multitrack audio recording is not available. Concretely this means that you can only record one audio source at a time.

The difference in performance between StreamLabs OBS and OBS would be in favor of StreamLabs, for encoding. However, it is difficult to know if this is really the case.

Also, StreamLabs OBS would be more RAM intensive than OBS, because of all the extra added features.

Again this is subject to debate: some say that StreamLabs is more efficient and others argue the opposite.

If you have a good streaming machine, you should have no problem running this software. For those who are borderline, try both and see which works best for you.

Also many more people use OBS than StreamLabs OBS, if you have a problem with OBS, there is a good chance you will find a solution. On StreamLabs OBS the community is smaller.

Finally, I was able to read on reddit that some users found that the quality of their livestream was better on OBS than on StreamLabs OBS. He would have had more frame drops on SLOBS than on OBS.
